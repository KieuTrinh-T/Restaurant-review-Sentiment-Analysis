1.1,5,"It is such a nice and romantic restaurant for new couples and family getting back the sweet memories.
Food is so nice with western courses. Drinks are interesting to enjoy. We had a very nice dinner with our boss and colleagues. Thank you for nice preparation as well.",en
1.2,4,"Food is marvelous.
We ordered the French onion soup which is my favourite, good as expected.
The pear salad my friend loved it very much.
The beef is good but the lamp rack is excellent, so tender and delivious, so I took more photo of it.
There are three things that worth comment, the restaurants seems too much emphasis on romantic place for meals, it seems awkward if you are not a couple.
The second thing is that we visited there for lunch , it was very quiet and the waiters seems not yet woke up for customers. We were actually the only people there for the period. And the waiter there seemed very curious why there were people coming for lunch.
The last thing is very disgusting, I have taken a photo but deccided not to post. The washrom was very dirty and the wash basin left with some …………..
I like the food but I am not sure I should go back again. May be dinner but absolutely not lunch.
And please clean the toilet before you open for business.",en

1.6,5,A small yet very interesting European fusion themed restaurant tucked away in District 1 just over the plaza from the hotel street. The menu is both comprehensive yet in no way compromises on either presentation or quality as each dish was fantastic quality. The owner was also quite involved with the desserts especially and was more than happy to explain how each one was made and presented which gave a nice personal touch. By local standards however this place can get pricey but for something different yet great I would easily recommend this place.,en
1.7,5,"We really wanted to eat beef steak.  In the next steakhouse, the price went for 2 million dong for 200g.  And at the little door, the price is 4 times cheaper.  The steak is simply divine, the coffee is delicious, the desserts too.  Remained extremely satisfied.  We’ll come here many more times.  the service is top notch.  even for the sake of such hospitality",en
1.8,5,"Went there for lunch and had a very nice time enjoying fine and sophisticated cuisine. Chef is quite inventive and doesn't hesitate to mix ingredients, recipes and cultures. Staff was very nice and supportive, even helped us with the kid so we can enjoy our dish!",en
1.9,4,"Nice cafe with good spaghetti.

Love the truffle mushroom (with veg option). Is a pricey one (VND350K) but is worth it. Personally does not like the overpowering black pepper taste that covered the truffle taste.

Does not like the pizza as it is not thin crust.

Hope to try other dishes next time.",en
1.10,5,"The place is quite romantic, suitable for couples and small families. In the evening, they light up candles and put roses (plastic) on all the tables regardless of whether you book in advance or not. They also have combo for decorations/ anniversary cakes. They mainly serve fusion food but it's ok just to order cakes and teas (combo available too). The price is ok, around 40,000 ~ 80,000/ piece of cake. Taste a little sweeter than I thought but everything was fine. I like the vibe here. The staff was very kind, he even spoke so softly that sometimes I could hardly hear what he was saying 🤣 10% VAT and 5% service charge.
Parking next to Saigon Centre (with fee).",en
1.11,5,"I had an afternoon tea with rum raisin ice cream. The rum raisin in the ice cream was so flavourful and perfectly went along with the home made ice cream.
I knew that they are famous as a place to celebrate our anniversaries but actually didn't know that the deal is available at around 1 mil dong. It's literally a no-brainer given their excellent food quality and ambience. Besides the anniversary celebration, they apparently have good deals on Monday and Tuesdays. So I will definitely come back for a feast.",en
1.12,5,"Excellent western restaurant with reasonable price.
Good location, only few minutes walking from Bitexco and Takashimaya.
The staff is very friendly and well services.
Will come back, definitely.",en
1.13,5,"A tasty experience in European food, with a specialty fusion menu for those who love to explore the more creative side of this restaurant.

Cozy interior and decor, with great personal touches here and there, and great service makes dining here very enjoyable.",en
1.14,5,The food here was fantastic and I had a great experience. 👍👍I would personally like to thank Mr Tri Bao for serving us tonight. To anyone coming to this restaurant please ask for Mr Tri Bao because he provides excellent service and is very nice and helpful. I think this man needs a raise and should be promoted. The restaurant wouldn’t be the same without him. 💯💯💯👌👌👌👌,en

Worst service in HCM!",en

1.20,5,This palace shocked you bcoz its location.its located in a side alley .but when you see this palace its super.ambience.staff.presentation and food everything amazing. I ordered crispy chicken and my whole vietnam trip this is the best chicken i ate .so 5 star rating.must visit,en
1.21,3,"Venue and decoration are very nice. Ideal for taking pictures. They actually decorate the table according to birthday or anniversary, nice touch.

However the food is very average.
- bread (free) is dry and tastes like 1 day old.
- lots of choices with truffle, we chose the salmon tartare, pasta with chicken, ravioli, but none of them taste truffle, but rather heavy garlic.
- beef wellington was ok.",en
1.22,3,"Food is so so , it's a place to take fancy photos with fancy decor. Expected much more quality food for the price. Typical place in Vietnam that focuses on looks rather than quality.  Waiter work very quick though.",en
1.23,5,"The place is absolutely gorgeous, the Milano pasta was perfectly cooked, and the staffs are friendly. Highly recommended",en
1.24,1,"Planned to celebrate my fiance birthday, so we went to inspect the restaurant. The restaurant looks nice, so we wanted to reserve the particular table for next weekday. However, we were told that we can reserve but they can not guarantee the table. Because the table is for 4 persons, not 2 persons. So, if they have 4 customers need the table, we have to move to smaller table. What the hack ?!?!? What is the point of booking !?!? It is like they try to fish 2 fishes but only have one bait! So, we felt disgusting and walked away. I will ensure my family and friend not going to this restaurant. Thumb down 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",en
1.25,5,Awesome dinner. Beautiful restaurant with delicious black angus steak.,en
1.26,5,"Steak is very good, highly recommend. Nice service too",en
1.27,5,Very nice set up restaurant. Romantic European style with fine dining concept but the price is almost half compared to others. Excellent food.,en
1.28,5,One of the best places for celebrating your anniversary with someone you loved and the service also amazing.,en
1.29,5,I came back last night. Still very good experience. Tried black angus rib eye at the price of 528K++ for 200g. So tender and juicy with good price.,en
1.30,1,"Ah yes, this place. We ordered two appetizers, two entrees and two drinks. The appetizers went first then the two drinks. My friend then noticed three bugs on the one of the drinks and we proceed to returned it. Manager then made some excuses whether they checked it, blah blah,... Well, we just want to returned the two entrees, had the check and leave. Lo and behold, they only took out the one drink that had the bugs and we couldn't cancel the two entrees, even though the entrees weren't served yet. All and all, very disappointed. Seems like all the money go to the nice decor and other things and not the standard.",en
1.31,5,"Great discovery! The Little Door is literally,  a cute little door next to a massage place. Place is very cozy and well attended. Had the clam chowder and spaghetti a la bolognese.  You can tell everything is homemade, including the dinner rolls which can accompanied by truffle butter...bonus! I understood from the owner that they're also a bakery. Portions are European standard, great for a light but very tasty lunch. I cant wait to return for dinner. The pizza in the menu looked really good.",en
1.32,5,"Atmosphere was great, portion was more than acceptable and they had lovely violin playing which was the icing on the cake.",en
1.33,3,"Well presented and prepared  food. Service was good. If they want to attract the discerning clientele, then for goodness sake change the god awful music. Soft soap Christian  revival played in an endless loop is like torture for the soul. Heard the same bland soft-soul cover versions at least four times.  Maybe also take the lights down a bit. Too bright..",en
1.34,1,"Shocking- I am astounded at the high reviews!! The place is bloody incompetent. The picture of the salmon cake was massively deceptive. I reckon it was less than 50 grams!! 4-5 cm diameter and about 1cm thick - you would expect that it’s a free sample!! The duck breast was ample size but over cooked, tough & dry!
Ordering was a game of charades. There is nothing worse than have some illiterate boy bobbing his head as if he understands and worse popping in the occasional ok - it’s tantamount to lying and is just infuriating!! It took several tries to get him to go get someone that understands!!
This place is damn hopeless; do yourself a favor and avoid it",en

1.38,5,"Amazing restaurant with very special food - WAGYU BEEF WELLINGTON.
I had tried beef Wellington in some places in Vietnam but here, THE LITTLE DOOR made me so surprised. The beef is not tenderloin, but Wagyu striploin  is really fantastic combination with their homemade flaky puff pastries. The beef is well seasoned with salt and pepper + special 3 year old shiitake.

1.119,1,"Bảo vệ nhà hàng thái độ bất lịch sự, đã rất nhiều lần tự ý cho xe của khách đỗ ở đường đi chung (đầu đường Trương Quyền) và trước cửa chung cư 86. Toàn xe lớn, lấn chiếm đậu xe hết nửa con đường dù đường đi không phải của nhà hàng. Nhắc nhở thì bảo vệ thái độ thách thức, còn tự nhiên thu tiền giữ xe mặc dù không hề thấy ai canh xe, chỗ thì lấn chiếm lạm dụng.
Thứ 7, Chủ nhật thì đỗ xe rất lâu, đậu từ 5h chiều 6h tối tới 9 10h đêm mới ra lấy xe. Và đương nhiên bảo vệ tự động thu tiền giữ xe đút túi riêng.
Xin nhắc lại đây là đường đi của chung và có 2 chiều, không phải chỗ để đậu xe nhà hàng.
Hi vọng nhà hàng giải quyết vấn đề này sớm, chứ đỗ xe lấn chiếm hết đường làm xe của người khác không thể vào được, còn bị hiểu nhầm là xe của người trong chung cư và yêu cầu dời xe đi.
Xin cám ơn.",vi

The owner of the restaurant couldn't achieve his dream of opening a restaurant because he didn't have money, so he posted on Facebook and the people who saw the post invested $100 or $200 to collect money and open the restaurant with a small investment.

The inside is antique and the fat is high, so when the music resonates
Feel is very full.
A place worth visiting
You can drink coffee and drinks separately in the small outdoor garden, and the garden is small and pretty.

You order food by looking at the pictured menu.
There are quite a few foods that are not available.
Among them, lamb dishes and lotus salad are good.

Sometimes when I'm out of my mind
This is a great place to visit !",en

Món ăn tươi ngon, tuy nhiên có vẻ như khách không nhiều hay sao mà lượng đồ ăn có sẵn không đủ. Mình order cá Tuyết cho 7 người nhưng không đủ dù mới đầu giờ tối.

4.1,5,"Chả cá Lã Vọng là một trong nhiều món ăn đặc trưng của ẩm thực Hà thành, một vùng đất có nền văn hóa ẩm thực đậm bản sắc và lâu đời.
Tương truyền vào những năm thời kỳ Pháp thuộc, ở số 14 Hàng Sơn (phố Lã Vọng ngày nay) có một gia đình họ Đoàn sinh sống. Họ thường lấy nhà mình làm nơi cưu mang nghĩa quân Đề Thám. Chủ nhà hay làm món chả cá rất ngon đãi khách, lâu dần thành quen, những vị khách ấy đã giúp gia đình mở một quán chuyên bán món ăn này, vừa để nuôi sống gia đình, vừa làm nơi họp hành.
Trong nhà hàng luôn bày một ông Lã Vọng – Khương Tử Nha ngồi bó gối câu cá – biểu tượng của người tài giỏi nhưng đang phải đợi thời. Có lẽ vì tích đó nên khách ăn quen gọi là Chả cá Lã Vọng, ngày nay trở thành tên của một nhà hàng và cũng là tên của món ăn. Bí quyết làm chả cá chỉ truyền lại cho người con cả người họ Đoàn.
Lâu dần, hai tiếng “Chả Cá” được gọi thành tên phố. Chả cá Lã Vọng trở thành món ăn nổi tiếng khắp xa gần từ lúc nào không hay.",vi

7.93,5,"Ngày lễ phải tranh thủ đặt bàn ăn gia đình, phòng riêng, chứ không ở dưới sân, khu vực ngoài trời rất đông và ồn, có âm thanh âm nhạc karaoke + hôm đó Việt Nam đá banh nên chiếu luôn.
Mình đặt món, có đặt cọc cho phòng riêng, lưu ý nếu bạn có nhu cầu xem tivi hay karaoke nên đặt trước vì phòng để trưng tivi chứ không dùng được.
Món ăn tạm ok, cho nhiều loại nước chấm để tự dùng. Khai vị có món cá phi lê tẩm mè ko biết dùng cá gì và do tẩm mè quá nhiều nên bị át vị mè luôn. Cơm chiên mà ít topping quá. Chén soup cua 50k khá thất vọng. Do đi rơi vào dịp Lễ cuối tuần may là đặt món trước mà nhân viên báo chốt dọn món thì phải báo trước 20p, còn order món mới chờ tận 45p, thấy thế nên gia đình ko tận hưởng thưởng thức được thêm nhiều món.

7.96,1,"Heo tộc nướng lu ngon nhưng nhiều mỡ. Nhiều món hải sản mình order thì nhà hàng báo hết. Lẩu King nổi tiếng của quán giá quá cao chỉ được vài miếng thịt đông lạnh dù nước lẩu mẻ ăn khá ngon nhưng quá đắt tiền cho 1 nồi lẩu chỉ toàn đậu phụ. Phần lẩu 900k hơn nói là cho 5 người mà hai vợ chồng mình ăn còn không no, phải nhường cho ba mẹ. Sẽ ko quay lại vì Sài Gòn có nhiều nhà hàng khác xuất sắc hơn với mức giá vừa phải hơn.

Edit: mình vừa chỉnh sửa review thành 1 sao vì cách nhà hàng trả lời mình. Viết có vẻ dài nhưng cốt chỉ đôi co với khách chứ không thật sự quan tâm đến khách hàng. Nhà hàng của bạn đề giá cao nên dĩ nhiên sản phẩm phải là đồ tươi ngon và tuyển chọn kỹ lưỡng. Chuyện này là điều dĩ nhiên chứ không phải là bonus là extra.

1. Heo tộc ngon. Mình nhấn mạnh mình không chê món này. Nhưng mình kèm thêm nhiều mỡ để ai có chế độ ăn kiêng phải suy nghĩ.

2. Mình order sò huyết, mực trứng, nhân viên báo không có và mình chọn món khác, ok. Nhưng món signature mà nhà hàng quảng cáo rầm rộ là cá tầm cũng không có hàng. 🙂

3. Lẩu Vua. Mình chẳng cần biết bạn dùng bí kíp 31 gia vị gì. Bạn dọn lên 1 nồi lẩu chưa tương xứng với giá tiền thì mình có quyền chê. Mình được 5 lát cá hồi mỏng như ăn sashimi. 5 khoanh cừu cắt lát mỏng cuộn lại. Dĩa thịt bò cũng lát đát vài miếng. 15 con nghêu, 5 con tôm, 5 thanh cua và 1 mớ 3-4 thể loại tàu hủ. Thậm chí mỳ vắt mà bạn nói còn chỉ là mỳ gói, không được cả mỳ trứng. Phần lẩu này có xứng trên 900k không ạ? Mình có góp ý với em nhân viên ngay là phần lẩu giá cao mà chỉ thấy tàu hủ, mấy em nhân viên chỉ bẽn lẽn cười rồi không giải quyết gì.

Thấy nhà hàng quảng cáo là hợp vệ sinh, thấy review cũng ổn nên tới thử.. Bước vào thấy không gian đẹp, rộng rãi, cũng có sân vườn nhưng không xô bồ như những quán khác, còn có nhạc dập dìu nữa :)). Bên trái là khu chọn hải sản tươi sống, kết quán cái điểm này, thích cái gì chỉ phát là nhân viên vớt lên chế biến ngay, không sợ ăn phải đồ để lâu.  . Mình và ông xã ngồi 1 bàn khá đẹp trên ban công tầng 2, nhìn xuống đường nhộn nhịp khá lãng mạn. Bé nhân viên ân cần hỏi han, giới thiệu món và giá (hải sản ở đây tính theo thời giá). Thấy món cua khá ok nên gọi thử và thêm vài món cá, tôm khác nữa. Quán chế biến hơi lâu làm 2 vợ chồng phải ngồi selfie giết thời gian, nhâm nhi gỏi trước. Một lúc sau thì món chính cũng ra, nhìn thôi là thấy ko cưỡng được rồi, cua rang me có màu cam rất đẹp, trang trí đẹp mắt. Cua chắc, thơm, không ốp dù lúc đó đang rằm. Món tôm đút lò phô mai hơi ngậy tí nhưng bắt vị, sò huyết ok, tôm càng nướng hơi quá lửa nên vài chỗ bị cháy sém. . 2 vợ chồng kêu 6 món ăn no nê hết tầm 900k, chắc tại toàn món đắt tiền. . Rất thích toilet ở đây, máy lạnh phà phà mát mẻ, vô cùng sạch sẽ, có nến với cả tinh dầu nữa, thơm phức. Mình là nữ và khá kỹ tính nên những điểm như thế này mình rất quan tâm, quan trọng là phải sạch sẽ.",vi

hình ảnh ko liên quan",vi
8.122,3,"""Giá đắt"" so với sản phẩm và chất lượng phục vụ mình đã nhận được. mình không quay lại quán này. Đợi món siêu lâu.  Cụ thể như sau:

1/ Không gian: Không đẹp lắm, ồn,khói thuốc lá nhiều, không gian ồn y chang mấy quán nhậu bình dân,

Các bàn xếp khá gần nhau nên rất ồn, ở đấy nói chuyện mình phải nói lớn thì người kế bên mới nghe được. Hút thuốc lá ko hợp với trẻ nhỏ.
Cảm quan đầu tiên khi mới vào cửa là nhà hàng có vẻ xịn, nhưng mang hơi hướng style của nhà nước.
Bước vào trong thì không gian trong quán rộng, tuy nhiên các bàn xếp khá sát nhau, quán ồn kinh khủng, không khí y chang quán nhậu bình dân, ngoại trừ khung cảnh xung quanh đẹp ra thôi chứ không khí như vâyj thì không ra dáng một nhà hàng, vẫn giống quán nhậu bình dân khoác lên cái áo tên Nhà hàng mà thôi.
Quán khá nóng, mình khôg ngồi phòng vip nên không có máy lạnh là hiển nhiên, nhưng mật độ bàn dày xếp sát nhau, bàn nào cũng thuộc dạng bàn 6_10 người nên khá nóng mà lại không có quạt.

2/ Phục vụ: Tạm, có đôi khi dưới trung bình.
Ấn tượng về phục vụ: ko theo tiêu chuẩn nhà hàng, khi dọn chén bát ra thì thảy chén xuống bà kêu côm cốp, đáng lý phải để nhẹ nhàng mới đúng, giá món ăn không rẻ, nhưng còn thua mấy quán phục vụ khác như: BBQ, sushi haru, gogi...giá rẻ hơn mà phong cách phục vụ lịch thiệp hơn.

Không ngồi phòng vip nên ở ngoài, mọi người tự do hút thuốc, khói thuốc phà phà xung quanh ah,  sẽ không phù hợp cho cuộc gặp nào mà có em bé hay trẻ nhỏ

3/Món ăn: Tạm được
Món ăn thì nói chung tạm. Nhóm mình gọi nhiều món nhưng thấy ăn được thôi không thật sự đặc biệt.

4/Bột nêm rất nhiều:
Có món sup cua nêm bọt ngọt rất nhiều, bạn mình dị ứng bọt ngọt nên ăn món nào nhiều bọt ngọt là người nó phản ứng liền ah.

5/ Đừng gọi món lẩu cua: rất dở, khôg ngon, vị không ra gì

6/ tôm sú lúc mình gọi giá 650K/ kg, nhưng ăn cũng được thôi, chế biến không đặc biệt gì.

7/ Đợi món lâu lắm

8/ Giá: vì tất cả các điều trên từ 1_6

Nhưng nhiều món chắc không hợp khẩu vị mình ăn không thấy ngon. Có món bó bóp thấu thì ngon. Dê thì có mùi tanh quá. Cá nấu mẻ và sườn dê nấu cháo mình ăn không quen. Cá tầm khá béo.

Có những món rất nhạt ví dụ như soup cua nhưng mà rất may có sốt xí muội vớt lại. Ngoài ra lý do lớn nhất để mình đánh giá 3sao là vì khi bưng món cơm hải sản hay gì đó ra thì có rất nhiều kiến trên dĩa, rất thiếu vệ sinh và cẩn thận.

Quán có lối đi cầu thang hơi bé xíu cho a e nào quá cỡ như mình. Mình gọi sét đầy thịt ăn được 1/2 và mang về 1/2. Đồ ăn mềm ngọt với hương vị BBQ , 4 loại nước chấm theo khẩu vị của bạn.

2/ Giá: phù hợp với chất lượng, trung bình giá khoảng 300,000 - 500,000VND/ người, đã bao gồm bia.

3/ Nhân viên: đông nhưng phục vụ hơi chậm.

Nhược điểm: phía ngoài nhà hàng chưa thu hút khách, chưa tao được điểm nhấn và không gian cho khách cảm thấy thực sự đặc biệt; nhà vệ sinh nam cảm giác chưa kín đáo, dễ gây mùi cho sảnh, thiết kế cũng chưa đẹp; nhân viên phục vụ chủ động hơn trong khâu phục vụ, không đợi khách hỏi thì mới làm; thức ăn cần trang trí bắt mắt hơn nhất là món Cá mú hấp HongKong chưa đẹp, mực chiên giòn trang trí sơ Sài.

The staff said it was ok as long as it’s small, doesn’t roam around and disturb other customers, which fit us perfectly. So I asked to book a table and was told to just come right away, I told them I couldn’t because we live in D7. Anyway they don’t make reservations for 2 pax so off we went. We entered the restaurant and the staff was all chaotic when seeing me hold a 2.7 kg Pomeranian. They turned us away rudely and said our dog was too big!!! No alternatives was offered while we came all the way from D7. The security man was nice and offered to look after our dog if she’s leashed and tied to the stairs. We decided to leave because I was so mad being treated that way. By the time we arrived in D7, all restaurants were closed. We will never go back there even without our dog because the service is obviously inconsistent and unprofessional.

Thiết kế quán cũng bt luôn mà đông khách dã man, menu k đa dạng lắm, cả hình minh họa to rõ mà cuốn menu có tầm 4 trang thôi nhưng món ăn thì chất lượng: mì lạnh cay làm ngon, màu sắc hấp dẫn, mì trộn cay cũng tương đối giống mì lạnh màu sắc tươi hơn tí, món thịt cổ heo nướng bưng tới bàn còn nghe tiếng xèo xèo đã tai, thịt rất mềm k hề dai tí nào. Quán đa phần là khách hàn, khách đông, muốn gọi thử món trứng hấp mà đông quá bạn nv có báo là làm k kịp sẽ ra món lâu. nv nhận order k ghi giấy nên quên ra món canh kimchi cho tụi mình. Lúc tính tiền có nói lại vs thu ngân và được bỏ món liền k mất time kiểm tra lằng nhằng. Nc trải nghiệm tốt, 4 ng ăn v cũng thấy no r.
Mấy dĩa nhỏ vs cơm là đồ ăn kèm k tính vào bill. Tổng bill có 3 món: 510k",vi
25.109,4,"Mình ăn ở quán 2 lần rồi nên các bạn có thể tin tưởng đánh gí này của mình
1. Ưu điểm:
- Món ăn ngon, đồ ăn kèm nhiều, chuẩn vị và không gian Hàn từ cơm, panchan, món chính
- Không gian rộng rãi, tha hồ bàn ghế ngồi ăn
- Lần 1 mình ăn 2 người hết 440k, hôm sau mình ăn 7 người, mỗi người hết 150k.
2. Nhược điểm
- Phục vụ chậm
- Đồ ăn giá chát với người Việt nhìn chung, nhưng được cái ăn ngon lắm
Một số điểm chú ý khi gọi món ở đây:
- Ở đây có set thịt xào cay hay thịt nướng gì gì đó đầu menu best seller combo trưa cho 2 người. Nhưng khi mình đi 2 người gọi set đó thì nhà hàng nói gọi thêm món nữa vì chỉ 1 set đó panchan k nhiều, nếu sau mìn gọi thêm món, môi lần chỉ ra 1 ít panchan 2 người k đủ ăn, nên phải gọi thêm món khác :(
- Canh kim chi 160k/1 bát
- Mỗi món giá dao động từ 220-300k, mình k nhớ cụ thể nhưng đại khái tầm đó. Panchan có cá thu miếng cá to nhưng k ngon, mình chẳng bao giờ ăn tới.
- Kimchi hơi ít nên phải gọi thêm.
Với cả mọi người đừng thấy chỉ có 1 bát cơm ko đủ, vì 1 bát còn ăn k hết đó. Nên cứ ăn xong rồi gọi thêm. Thường mỗi bát cơm sẽ có 1 bát canh kim chi theo cùng. Tuy nhiên canh đó chỉ có vài cọng giá thôi nha. Phải hỏi kỹ có được bao nhiêu bát canh theo số người ko, vì có thể đi 7 mà chỉ được 5 bát thôi.
———————

I've eaten at Hansol restaurant twice, so you can trust in my review
1. Advantages:
- Delicious food, lots of panchan dishes, standard taste and Korean space
- Space is spacious, comfortable
- The first time cost 440k vnđ for 2 people, the next day my team with 7 people, 150k vnđ/per 1 people.
2. Cons
- Slow service
- The food is expensive for Vietnamese people in general, but the food is delicious
Some points to notice when ordering here:
- There is a set of spicy stir-fried meat or grilled meat, st like that here. Best-seller is lunch combo for 2 people. But when I ỏdered this set, the restaurant said we had to order more dishes because panchan each set is not much, if I order the second dish later, we couldn’t not have panchan enough for 2 people, so I have to order 2 set in 1 turn.
Morover, Kimchi soup 160k / 1 bowl
- Each dish ranges from 220-300k, I don't remember the specifics
Panchan included big pieces of fish but it's not delicious, I never eat
- Kimchi is a bit small, so I have to order more. For everyone, don't think that just 1 bowl of rice is not enough. 1 bowl is over 😂
Usually each bowl of rice will have 1 bowl kimchi soup included
However, that soup only has a few stalks of bean sprouts. Be sure to ask carefully how many bowls of soup according to the number of people, because you can go 7 but only get 5 bowls.
Thank u for reading, Like if it’s useful!",vi

+ về mì lạnh hansol thì ăn đến đâu mát đến đó ăn tầm 2 lần thì cảm giác chua. Giá tầm 150k

Điểm cộng đồ ăn nhiều và ngon, mình gọi 2 phần mì, 1 mì lạnh vs 1 mì trộn cay, 2 món món nào cũng ngon, mì trộn ngon mà hơi ít, quán có đa dạng panchan ko tính tiền
Điềm trừ là nhân viên, minh tới là 7h15 tối chủ nhật nhưng quán đông hết bàn và mình chấp nhận chờ. Chờ tầm 30’ thì mình có vào hỏi nhân viên và được vào quán, sau tụi mình có 2 nhóm bạn khác và vào sau, quán đông nhân viên chưa kịp dọn bàn mình có thể thông cảm nhưng nv cứ dắt khách đi lòng vòng, rồi đến lúc 2 nhóm bạn kia đã đc sắp bàn trong khi mình tới trước thì k đc sắp bàn, mình hỏi bạn nv nam thì báo là bạn ko biết ai tới trước? Bạn ko biết nhưng bạn cũng ko hỏi luôn? Tiếp theo là bạn nhân viên nữ trong hình, tụi mình hỏi có ngồi bàn này (trống) đc ko thì bạn í báo là ko ngồi đc trong khi các bàn khác thì chưa dọn, mình hỏi lí do bạn í nói có khách đặt rồi. B cũng ko linh động để giải quyết vđ bàn cho tụi mình, sau đó 1 nhóm khách ng nước ngoài vào thì b lại xếp 1 bàn khác, vs nhân viên ở đây theo mình thấy họ chú trọng khách Hàn hơn khách Việt, or có thể do mình xui :)) đồ ăn lên nhanh, or do món mình đơn giản nên lên nhanh, nhưng mà chán b nhân viên nữ này thiệt sự. Duy nhất có 1 bạn tròn tròn thấp thấp nghe nói là mới vào thì phục vụ tụi mình oke chứ ko chắc mình chỉ có thể đánh giá 1 sao. Mình hi vọng quán khắc phục tình trạng nhân viên or tuỷen thêm nhân viên để mấy bạn bớt áp lực khi khách đông để phục vụ tất cả khách đều như nhau, dù quán là quán Hàn nhưng vẫn nằm trên đất Việt mà?",vi

- Về đồ ăn: chất lượng ổn, phần ăn kèm đầy đủ, tuy nhiên không đặc sắc.
- Về cung cách phục vụ: mình đi 2 người một nam một nữ vào buổi tối, do cũng không rõ là nhà hàng bố trí như thế nào vì tới lần đâu, phía trước còn trống rất nhiều bàn nhưng nhân viên lại hướng dẫn mình ra khu phía sau, mình có hỏi tại sao thì nhân viên vẫn mời mình ra phía sau và không cho biết lý do. Sau khi gọi món và ăn được 1 nửa (mình kêu 4 món chính) thì có 2 Oppa đi từ khu vực phía trước xuống khu phía sau móc điếu thuốc ra hút phì phèo rất gần bàn mình. Lúc bấy giờ mình tính quay qua nói thì mình chợt nghĩ ra đây có thể là khu vực bàn hút thuốc. Thật sự không hiểu các bạn nghĩ gì trong khi bàn trống phía trước (không hút thuốc) rất nhiều nhưng lại hướng dẫn mình ra phía sau (bàn hút thuốc), không cho biết lý do trong khi mình đi 1 nam 1 nữ. Cực kì khó chịu tuy nhiên mình không tiện đổi bàn vì cũng trễ rồi, không muốn phiền các bạn phục vụ phải bưng hết > 10 dĩa thức ăn nên 2 đứa ăn thêm được 1 ít rồi về.

Vị trí quán gần sân bay, ngay mặt tiền đường Hồng Hà rất dễ thấy. Chỗ đậu xe rộng rãi, chỗ ngồi hơi nhỏ nhưng sạch sẽ.

Mình chứng kiến người này bĩu môi hết khách này đến khách nọ, lầm bầm sau lưng khách với lời lẽ khinh miệt. Bán hàng không bắt buộc niềm nở nhưng tối thiểu phải tôn trọng khách hàng.
Không riêng mình mà tất cả các bạn đi cùng đều cảm nhận như vậy sau khi đi ăn về và quyết định không bao giờ quay lại. Kéo xuống cũng có nhiều review về thái độ nhưng tới hôm nay vẫn chưa thấy khắc phục, còn phản hồi đốp chát.

The price is not listed on the menu board and the downside is that there is no air conditioning. There are only three menus. Simple and clean food is served, and there are seats up to the 3rd floor.

Bạn mình ăn xong rồi mình gọi nhân viên lại mới thấy nhân viên làm. Quên món mình đã không nói gì rồi. Sau đó bưng ra 1 bát full ớt bên trên. Mình bảo đổi bát khác không ớt thì mang vào vớt bỏ rồi bưng ra đúng bát đó. Bạn nhân viên order thì bảo ớt trang trí thôi, nước dùng k cay. Ok. Bạn mình húp thử 1 thìa nước thì nó quá cay. Mình không ăn nữa và tính tiền thì nhân viên vẫn tính cả phần giả cầy dù mình bảo trả món, không ăn. Mình không đồng ý thì bạn nhân viên làm món đứng ở bếp nói lớn: Mày mang vào đây tao trả tiền bát đó. *** (văng tục) có mấy lát ớt mà làm thấy ghê... Bạn nó nói rất mất dạy và thái độ rất bố láo. Mình còn chưa nhận đc 1 câu xin lỗi nào, vẫn im lặng vì không muốn gây gổ nhưng bạn đó được nước làm tới, chửi oang oang. Bà chủ quán ngồi ngay đó không nói 1 câu nào.

The Filet mignon is ok at best, and is disappointingly overpriced.

The seafood fried rice here is especially delicious!!
It's really the best if you rub soy sauce + red pepper and eat it!

31.96,4,"Đây là quán quen thuộc của nhà mình, mỗi khi có dịp là cả nhà lại ra đây ăn tối. Nằm trong khuôn viên Supper Bowl, dễ thấy. Mình rất thích ăn ở đây vì không những đồ ăn ngon mà còn chất lượng, ông chủ quán Người Ý luôn kiểm tra đồ ăn trước khi mang ra, còn hay tặng thêm bánh kẹo cho nhà mình :)). . - Về Không Gian: Quán không quá cầu kì, cũng k hiện đại mà mang đậm chất Ý, đi quanh bạn thấy rất nhiều tranh và bản đồ nước Ý, có mấy tấm bản đồ vùng sản xuất đồ ăn đặc trưng nữa cơ. Không gian ấm cúng thích hợp cho gia đình. Có chỗ riêng cho khách hút thuốc ở bên trong. . . - Về Giá: giá không rẻ. Thích hợp cho gia đình hoặc Tây hoặc người có thu nhập kha khá, nhà hàng mà :) Món chính (mì, cơm, thịt ...) dao động từ 180-400K / món. Salad các loại tầm 160-200k, mình thích ăn salad cá ngừ hoặc jambon. Các món soup tầm 60-100k, ngon nhất vẫn là soup bí, tiếp theo là soup kem gà, soup kem nấm. Mì/nui Ý các loại (có nhiều loại mì, bạn có thể đổi nếu thích) tầm 179-280K, mình hay ăn mì dẹt xốt cà cay hoặc mì sốt kem. Cơm Ý cũng có mà cơm Việt cũng có, ngon nhất vẫn là mấy món cơm sườn tẩm mật ong hoặc sườn nướng, giá khoảng 200-300k. Có những món thịt cừu thịt bò đút lò ăn với khoai tây chiên/nghiền và salad thì khá mắc nhưng miếng to tổ chảng, ăn lòi luôn  giá toàn 350 trở lên cho mấy loại thịt hảo hạng đó. Pizza có nhiều size, mình thích nhất là pizza mamma's với pizza 4 cheese, giá (tuỳ size) từ 170-290K/cái. Ở đây cũng có mấy món canh Việt Nam hay cá kho thịt kho, bún phở các loại mà mình k ăn cũng k nhớ giá, vì ra quán Ý phải ăn đồ Ý chứ ha :)))) Tiếp đến là nước uống khá mắc, mình toàn đem chai nước suối đi thôi (vì mình thích uống nước suối), ba với anh mình hay gọi Ken ướp lạnh, uống trong chai luôn, k rót ra li đá, uống vậy đậm và ngon hơn  Mình có từng uống nước cam, 50k/ly, nhưng mình kêu ít đá (ngta cho đúng 3 viên bé bé) ít đường, ly vẫn đầy vẫn ngon mà k thêm tiền (giá mắc bỏ xừ rồi!) :)) Cuối cùng là tráng miệng có bánh và kem nhưng cũng mắc và k chuyên nên mình chưa thử, toàn ra ngoài ăn tráng miệng khác :p. . - Về Chất Lượng Món Ăn: theo khẩu vị của mình là ngon! Mình thích ở đây có phomai bột, rắc bao nhiêu tuỳ thích lên pizza hay mì hay salad đều ngon. Mỗi món cơm đều có kèm đồ chua hoăch salad (có thể dặn món ăn kèm). Món chính mỗi ngừoi 1 phần là ăn no căng nhe. Nhà mình hay đi 5 ngừoi mà gọi 3 món chính (mì, cơm này nọ) với 1 salad (vì ăn nhiều rau), 1 soup (cho em nhỏ nhưng nhà cũng ăn vì chén soup khá nhiều) và 1 pizza vừa (6 miếng, mỗi ng 1 miếng, riêng mình 2 miếng hehe) là ăn phè phỡn luôn í! Tổng bill thường tầm 600-800k. . . Mình ăn nhiều lắm rồi nên kể ra cũng dài, bạn nào muốn biết thêm thì ghi tên món, nếu mình đã ăn qua sẽ review cho nhé ;). - Enjoy your Italian meals -",vi

Đồ ăn ở đây càng ấn tượng hơn, theo mình cảm nhận là chuẩn vị cơm Hàn luôn nha. Tụi mình gọi 3 món
- Thịt heo sốt gia vị: giống như thịt xào rau củ và hành tây, thịt tươi ngon ít mỡ, nước sốt cay mặn ngọt, 1 phần là 1 đĩa rất to, có kèm cơm
- Súp thịt bò cay: là canh thịt bò nấu với giá+nấm+cải thảo+trứng, ban đầu nếm thử thấy hơi nhạt nhưng ăn một hồi thấy nước rất thơm và ngọt vị thịt, không phải hương vị của gia vị công nghiệp đâu, mình không nêm thêm gì vào canh luôn, chỉ ăn với cơm trắng thôi vẫn thấy rất ngon ạ 😭 tất nhiên là nó cay nhé, nhưng không chua vì không phải nấu với kimchi
- Mì lạnh trộn: một phần cũng siêu to luôn, chỉ có mì trộn sốt cay+nước súp lạnh ăn kèm chứ không có thịt nha, sốt trộn và nước súp có vị chua ăn rất đã, ăn tại quán sẽ có nước đá dùng kèm. Sốt mì không bị nồng mùi tương đậu.
Mua 3 món nhưng thựa ra bọn mình đi 2 người thì ăn được một nửa thôi, còn lại phải nhờ đóng gói mang về vì nhiều quá.
Các món ăn kèm ở quán rất nhiều luôn nhé, mà món nào cũng ngon, thích nhất là da heo trộn sốt cay, lần đầu đi ăn cơm Hàn mà thấy có da heo trong banchan đó ạ 😂 ăn hết có thể xin quán refill nha (mình thì chỉ xin refill da heo thôi vì nó ngon quá, còn mấy món kia ăn không hết luôn vì nhiều lắm), 2 loại kimchi khá cay, mặn vừa. Nhìn chung đồ ăn ở đây vị ÍT ngọt nha, ai không ít ăn ngọt thì tới đây ăn là chuẩn bài.
Quán có các cô chú người Hàn tới ăn rất đông, yên tĩnh và không có mở nhạc Kpop xập xình nên ngồi ăn rất thoải mái. Nhân viên quán nhiệt tình và vui vẻ, nói được cả tiếng Hàn và tiếng Việt nên mình cũng không rõ mấy anh chị là người Hàn hay Việt nữa 🥲
Giá cả hoàn toàn tương xứng với chất lượng. Có dịp sẽ quay lại vì đồ ăn ở đây ngon thật sự 🥲",vi

This, I've been told before hand, that it is part of a chain operated by the same group of people. First thing that comes to mind from experience was that chains are usually a hit or a miss.

My first impression upon entering was, clean and modern. Not a typical restaurant trying to mimic Vietnamese feel...and such was the case here. I felt  like it was fusion. Nonetheless, I liked it.

I thought the service was great. We had 2 staff members waiting nearby and a main lead that took all orders and serving dishes with the help of the other 2. They were attentive and not a moment our drinks were not attended to or an empty dish Sat idled. More importantly, they had smiles on their face. I had no complaints.

The presentation was nice, and as I had thought at first impression, it was fusion style. Which I didn't mind it at all. In fact, if was a nice twist with traditional ingredient.

The quality was really good but unfortunately it was not consistent throughout to warrant a 5 star. For instance, while the pan seared fish was tasty, the scallop were over cooked and visually dried. However, in general the dishes were good.

This place typical in pricing for a district 1 restaurant. It may be average to descent to foreigners, but definitely expensive for the locals.

Overall, I liked this restaurant and I can see myself coming back again.

4 stars!!!!",en

Essentially, the restaurant does not live up to it's glamorous appearance.

Additionally, the service i received was appalling. Despite arriving at 11:50, half of our dishes came out at 12:23. Four tables that had arrived later than ours recieved dishes that we had also ordered BEFORE our own.

Tôi yều cầu được ngồi bàn mà tôi thường ngồi  là kế bên. Họ nói là có người đặt bàn đó, ( bàn 4 chổi)  khoảng lúc sau có người tới họ chỉ định cho khách ngồi bàn đó khách trả lời họ muốn ngồi 1 bàn khác ( tôi thấy họ đi 5 khách) trong 6 năm qua tôi thường ngồi nên tôi chỉ muốn ngồi khi bàn trống . Ba phục vụ khu vực đó từ chối tôi ngồi  bàn tôi muốn, nhà hàng  nhiều bàn còn trống lúc tôi đến.
Khi gọi món thì nhiều món tôi thích trên menu đều hết. Tôi nghe ( nếu không nhầm) thì bàn đến sau tôi gọi món giống tôi gọi mà họ nói hết  thì còn ( món chả giò tôm) menu họ nói chả giò cua và chả giò tôm thịt hết, chỉ còn chả giò rau củ. Tôi đi với 1 người Tây da trắng. Chắc có thể  nhà hàng có thay đổi chủ hay nhân sự. Họ nhìn mặt mà bán những món hàng tồn đọng cho tôi.
Tôi từng giới thiệu bạn bè là nhà hàng 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Nnưng phải giới thiệu lại bây giờ  1⭐️
Tôi đến 6 giờ chiều tôi rời đi 7 giờ vẫn không có khách ngồi bàn mà họ cho rằng có khách đặt. Chắc khách đặt bàn đó cho mãi mãi họ  và đến ăn 12 giờ đêm ngày 16 âm lịch và tháng 7 âm lịch Và người phàm như tôi không có khả năng nhìn thấy những vị khách đó.",vi

Quán này bán món chay mấy năm nay rồi, đi ngang hoài mà chưa có dịp ghé, hôm bữa ghé ăn, cả 2 lần món ăn đều ok, tuy nhiên có những món nêm rất là đậm, rất là mặn, mình nghĩ món chay thì thì hương vị nhẹ nhàng thôi. Tiếp là quán không quá đông nhưng món ăn lên cực kỳ chậm, đợi rất lâu mới có món. Đường một chiều nữa hơi khó đi.. Lần đầu đi không sao, lần thứ 2 đi thì máy lạnh khu vực mình ngồi hình như không hoạt động, khá là nóng, bàn kế bên cũng nóng, thấy vậy nên mình nói nhân viên, nhân viên bảo là mở rồi, xong đi một nước. Mình ngồi đợi một hồi thấy nóng quá nói lần nữa, một nhân viên khác mới nói máy lạnh hư rồi, xong xoay cây quạt về phía bàn mình đang ngồi. Ngồi được tầm 10 phút mát thì bàn khác than nóng, nhân viên khác lại xoay cây quạt về phía bàn đó. Làm bàn mình và một bàn khác khá là nóng, ăn không ngon miệng nữa. Một hồi mình mới phát hiện đó là bàn của chủ quán (mình đoán vậy tại thấy ra lệnh, chỉ trỏ cho nhân viên nhiều) '_' Buôn bán gì mà không nhường khách giành cây quạt cho bằng được trong khi có mỗi chủ với cháu chủ chạy lăn tăn chứ không ngồi yên, còn khúc mình ngồi tới 5 người ~~.

Đã ăn vài lần, chất lượng khá ổn. Món chả Hương sen trình bày đẹp mắt nhưng mình mong đợi bên trong nhân đa dạng xíu chứ không chỉ là khoai viên tròn rồi chiên.

Thích nhất món canh chua. Nêm vừa miệng.

Những món mặn ăn với cơm với hợp vị.

Thỉnh thoảng sẽ bổ sung một vài loại nước mới như matcha hay sữa đậu khá ngon

Tổng kết:
- Không gian thanh tịnh, nhạc Phật nhẹ nhàng, khá đông vào buổi tối.
- Về thức ăn: ổn, nêm nếm vừa chỉ có mình kêu lẩu thái nhưng vị nêm khá chua, nghe mùi xả hơi nhiều.
- Vì khách đông nên nhân viên có hơi chậm, nhưng thái độ phục vụ tốt 👍",vi

Món nấm bào ngư đút lò ăn cũng rất ngon, mùi nấm không hanh, vị beo béo cùng với nước chấm chua mặn ngọt nhè nhẹ ăn rất thích. Đa số nhà hàng sử dụng thực phẩm tươi, hạn chế các sản phẩm được làm từ bột mì. Có điều giá thành còn hơi chát một chút, nội thất bàn ghế trông có vẻ hơi cũ.

But… Like a lot of western themed restaurants in VN the food is mostly overpriced and not as good. The sauerkraut was disappointing. And if you have money to burn - they have VERY overpriced and underwhelming steaks.",en

50.6,4,"Hard to believe that this place has existed since 1995 and I've only managed to come here for the first time a couple of years ago. 20 odd years ago, a Central European style Brauhaus must have been something incredibly exotic in Saigon, in the 2020s it seems rather old fashioned in a city full of trendy craft beer breweries.
The interior design is spot on, you really do feel like stepping into something that might as well be in Prague or Bratislava. A proper traditional pivnica. Apart from imported legit Pilsner Urquell that obviously comes at a price, they only brew two kinds of lager here, Pilsner style light and dark, of good quality. Again, this must have been something really special even a decade ago, but it seems quaint nowadays. Prices for beer are still very reasonable at 60k for a big glass. The food, however, mostly Vietnamese with a few porky Euro dishes thrown in, is overpriced. Quality is good and portions generous, but count on spending around 1 mil here for a table of 4.
Service is not terribly friendly either, but then that's authentic, too.
I still quite liked it and keep coming back",en

Với sự kết hợp hài hòa kiến trúc Châu Âu cổ với không gian nội thất ấn tượng đã thể hiện một văn hóa thưởng thức bia độc đáo trong một không gian tinh tế, thân thiện đầy cảm hứng, một điển hình phong cách ẩm thực mới đáp ứng
đầy đủ xu hướng ẩm thực hiện đại. Nhà hàng không chỉ là viện bảo tàng về bia, mà còn là không gian mở để gặp mặt và hàn huyên của những người có cùng khát vọng tìm về chất lượng nguyên gốc.

Tại Hoa Viên Pilsner Original, Quý khách có thể lựa chọn loại bia cao cấp với thương hiệu Hoa Viên đã được khẳng định về chất lượng và hương vị độc đáo gần 20 năm qua hoặc thưởng thức dòng bia tươi Pilsner Urquell tuyệt hảo được nhập khẩu từ Plzeň – Cộng Hòa Séc.

Nhà mình hay ăn ở đây mỗi cuối tuần, buổi tối khách nhiều nhưng phục vụ cũng nhiều, không lo bị bỏ bê hay mang thức ăn chậm. Đa số người Việt hay dẫn bạn bè, đối tác làm ăn nước ngoài đến ăn thử. Vừa ăn vừa nghe họ nói chuyện cũng khá vui, thấy bản thân cũng học hỏi được ít nhiều.

Chỉ có thịt bò, heo, cá điêu hồng nghêu và há cảo, vài món rau hấp cùng thịt băm, phía dưới là gạo và trứng muối để ăn xong có cháo dùng. Nước chấm có 3 loại để phù hợp với các loại thịt nhưng cảm thấy nước tương là ngon nhất. Nhân viên hướng dẫn nhiệt tình nhưng không đủ để kéo lại cảm tình dành cho món ăn.

Giá này bao gồm 3 phần khai vị: nấm chiên giòn ăn ok, salad và tàu hủ xốt xí muội ăn bình thường. Lẩu thì nước Tomyum ăn béo béo chua chua rất vừa miệng; đồ ăn thì có: cá viên, tôm, bạch tuộc mini, gà, gầu bò, ba chỉ. Tất cả kêu thêm thoải mái, kể cả khai vị. Trừ rau kêu thêm là 12k, mà mình thấy phần rau ban đầu cũng đủ 2 người rồi. Đồ ăn thấy khá tươi và ok, thịt mỗi khay để khá nhiều. Nhân viên nhiệt tình, nhẹ nhàng dễ thương, luôn túc trực để dọn dĩa, khay, châm thêm nước lẩu mà không cần gọi. Thái độ 10 điểm. Giá cả và chất lượng, sạch sẽ ân cần mà còn có máy lạnh là quá ok.

Thực đơn của Chill Thái Hà cực kỳ phong phú, bao gồm các món ăn từ ăn vặt và đồ chay cho đến các món chính nổi tiếng của Thái Lan như pad thai, tom yum, green curry, red curry, papaya salad, và cơm rang.

61.5,3,"We had a positive experience and the staff and decor were amazing. I’ve given 3 stars because my partner and I both felt the food was lacking for such a highly rated restaurant. We expected Asian fusion and a good amount of flavour. I’ve eaten at many restaurants, cheap and expensive. We got the most expensive set menu. Here, the food was cooked very well but often lacked seasoning. I appreciate sometimes flavours are delicate but this was bordering on bland. We had to ask for salt and pepper (none on the table) with the steak dish and to he honest it brought all the components to life and tasted delicious. It was a shame I had already eaten half of it before I asked.

Overall we had fun, but we didn’t get many Asian flavours and it felt like a restaurant with an identity crisis. It didn’t have the rich flavours of, of example, French cuisine or the spices of Vietnamese food. We left feeling we could have got something less refined, but much tastier for half the cost.",en

You are welcome with very professional staff, and you are invited to exchange with them in their language if you like so.

Talking more about food, the salmon is so good, a perfect cooking with a little butter-honey-lemon sauce, a high class dauphinois with thin baby coconut slices... and all other dishes are as good.

The food was the best we've eaten during our 4-day trip in Vietnam so it's much more than just a cool experience. Overall something we will never forget, thank you Blanc!",en
61.14,5,"Blanc is a restaurant with a new and unique concept (even if less “extreme” than the one of his brother “Noir Dining in the dark”, another top rated restaurant).

(Almost) all the team is made of deaf and hearing impaired people. Therefore, communication must be made through the signal language.

On the table, there is a simple and essential guide book to allow you to get a basic conversation with the staff.
Of course, it is not easy at all but a try is worth and, I think, also highly appreciated by the guys who work here.

Being a polyglot, I loved the idea (is not the signal language a foreign language as any other ? ) and, even more, the chance that the two owners gave to these guys who, as anybody else, try to make their jobs at their best.

What about the food ? Delicious but expect small portions and European prices.

It has been an incredible overall experience. Thanks so much, Blanc.",en
61.15,5,Amazing food - the pistachio purée with the beef main course was a revelation!

But this place (both blanc and noir) completely blew my mind and made this journey even more special. First time we visited blanc we (my brother and I) had no reservation but the staff welcomed us very warm-heartedly. The whole evening they were perfectly attentious and the food was just to die for. Don't expect streetfood, this is real cuisine!
About a week later we decided to bring our mother, a born vietnamese and vegetarian. She was not only enjoying the food but was also very touched by the humanistic concept of the restaurant and the wonderful people that work here. When she found out that there was noir downstairs she immediately wanted to go. So we made a reservation for the next day.
Dinner in the dark (lunch actually) was very well organized and executed. The vegetarian menu option was exquisite and quite divers (which is actually hard to find because a lot of other places have very little options for vegetarians). We had a lot of fun this noon and felt perfectly comfortable thanks to the perfect service!
So all in all, I cannot recommend blanc and noir enough! This experience will always have a special place in my heart and I'll always remember it with a smile!",en

61.70,4,"A restaurant where you can eat Vietnamese fusion at an affordable price. Located on the 2nd floor of Noir.
This restaurant is staffed by deaf people, and orders are taken using sign language. There is no problem because there is a polite guideline and follow-up, and I can spend a very enjoyable time because I will teach you with a smile. There are not so many menus, so you can choose from 2 types of soup, 2 types of salad, and 4 types of main dishes. There is also a course, but this time it is a la carte. Ordered chicken salad and vegan curry. Every plate is beautifully arranged and worth seeing. It seems to be Vietnam that edible flowers are on. You can share a pot of tea, and it's very smart to add hot water naturally.
Like Noir, I think Ho Chi Minh's charm is that there are such concept restaurants!",en
61.71,5,"I used the website to make an appointment, and I already wanted a set meal for the final exam. Lunch was noir.dining in the dark downstairs. It was a very shocking meal. The sign language restaurant for dinner still did not disappoint: pea cold soup, chicken salad, Angus black Beef and black sesame sorbet. It is also a fusion dish. When you are seated, the clerk will roughly explain the basic sign language, and then carefully read the sign language used for meals such as meat and vegetables (because you must communicate with the hearing-impaired clerk, it can only be used in Ho Chi Minh City), the overall is delicate and delicious. I think I should have ordered medium rare. The clerk said that there are only 10 restaurants like this (hearing-impaired clerks) in the world, and it is difficult for hearing-impaired people to find a job. The restaurant spent two years training the clerks.
In addition to the good quality of meals, such a restaurant is also very important for them to integrate into the society and make money with their own strength, and build their confidence and sense of accomplishment. I deeply feel that Taiwan should also have such an institution or restaurant. The brand’s Wuguang restaurant lunch and sign language dinner really let me learn a lot. By the way, next week the brand will have a hearing-impaired massage parlor (not sure if it’s the hearing-impaired or visually-impaired, I couldn’t hear clearly after eating too much earbags) opening.",en

Tôi và gia đình đã từng trải nghiệm bên “Noir. Dạ thực trong bóng tối”, hôm nay đi trải nghiệm thêm Blanc. Một mô hình mới.
Cùng một đầu bếp nên đồ ăn vẫn xuất sắc như Noir, nhưng lần này chúng tôi được thỏa mãn đôi mắt với tài hoa của đầu bếp.
Và hơn hết là được giao lưu và sống trong thế giới của những bạn nhân viên khiếm thính- người Điếc ở đây, được hướng dẫn và sử dụng tay để giao tiếp thay vì nói chuyện thông thường.

63.1,4,"I was delighted to see there was a decent Western restaurant close to the airport. The food was OK but not great. That said, I only had the barbecue pulled pork pizza which I found the sauce to be a little too sweet. Vegetables with good though. The staff took care to follow instructions to have no onion and less garlic without stirfry vegetables. Happy to see a good selection of craft beers on the menu. If I had the opportunity to try other dishes on the menu, maybe I would would score higher. I can’t forget to mention that I was well surprised to see the ++ on the bill. I must have missed it on the menu but we had a 5% service charge and 10% tax on top of that. Felt like I was in back in Bali for a moment there.",en
63.2,5,"The ingredients are fresh, but I wish the food could have been cooked better. The craft beer is great and there are varieties to choose from. The service is great. I’ll give it an 8.0. I like the burger.",en
63.3,4,"We ordered a Set Lunch! Just 119.000VND + TAX not beverages included. Food was good, staff nice… just we expected more from starter 😅. We will came back!",en
63.4,5,Been here 3 times in a month since coming to Ho Chi Minh.  Very good food!  Everything I ordered so far was amazing!,en
63.5,5,"We had our dinner at Bg pig. Grilled food is always our favourite. Not all the times we can come across such fantastic grilled food. The fish was so soft and tender, and the oysters are juicy. Last but not least, their service was fantastic. Highly recommended!",en
63.6,5,"Really great food, lots of flavour and nice spicy seasoning.
I recommend the bbq pineapple 🍍",en
63.7,5,Travellers to Saigon would be well advised to check out Big Pig BBQ and craft beer restaurant. First class craft beer and a varied BBQ menu with classic rib variations with a local twist. Friendly staff are proficient in English  and a meal with drinks will cost about d475000 or £15. Unbeatable,en
63.8,2,"Drinks & beer selection were fine, the food however disappointed.  We asked for a burger to be medium rare, came out well done. We also ordered one of their meat platters, all of it sucked. Ribs were dry, wings were cold, sausage was oddly under grilled.",en
63.9,5,"What a delightful experience. Great cocktails & beers etc. I was particularly impressed with the steamed/bbq dishes served at the tables . Lots of delicious looking seafood & meat dishes , also steamed morsels. All reasonably priced and served with great aplomb.",en

63.11,5,Great food and friendly people. Food was perfect - tasty and good flavor for Americans and My Vietnamese friend.  Nice to see and chat with other foreigners!  I even got to watch my favorite sports team from America!  Definitely a great spot if you're near the airport.,en
63.12,5,"Food was delicious and incredibly fresh. Pizzas were soft and cheesy, definitely recommend the pork belly, crispy and juicy. Absolutely worth visiting! Came on a Monday and received their two for one pizza special which worked well for our group of six.",en
63.13,4,"Since 2017 this bar restaurant concept has been very famous among airport workers and dwellers, pilots of VJA and VNA meet here very often as well as office workers from buildings nearby.
A good substitution for Al Fresco's abit over priced and smaller portion.
Here in big pig we get full and drunk with half the visit.
Worth the visit!
Nice staff, good , very good food..good home made beers and drafts. Close to the airport and some 4 star hotels IBIS and appartments... And good price.",en
63.14,1,"We ordered the chicken burger, pork belly and chicken pizza. The only good thing was the starter with garlic bread. The burger was super bland and tasteless and the bun horribly floppy, not crispy at all, no sauces no nothing. The pork belly was very dry and burnt and the pizza was bad. Obviously a place for more drinking rather than eating....was hoping for more quality, though with the prices they asked. 1 M VDN!!!! Way too expensive....don't go.",en
63.15,5,"Tasty burgers at good price.
Large menu with many Western options, and good nightly specials, all near the airport.
I'll definitely be back",en

We have some snack such as salad , sausage , pizza.. I like the pizza . However the sausage is nice ingredients however they just boil the sausage . They not grilled sausage . So the sausage still stuck with water inside the sausage meat. I didn’t expect the grilled sausage come like that
However the dinner is cool . Prices abit w expensive but can acceptable . Must try pizza .",en

63.20,1,"Big scam to end our trip to vietnam. 500000 dong for just 2 drinks and 2 plates (spaguetti and noodles). The most expensive meal we had, but it was not necessarily the best! Expensive at the start on which we add + 10% tax and + 5% service charge. of course, it's written in small on the card... To avoid !!!",en

Had to wait awhile for service 🙄
But definitely worth trying!",en
63.23,4,"I think they just changed owner and all staffs are new and inexperienced not really giving good service.
However, the owner knows how to pour a good beer, a newly opened rooster beer is really good !

Foods are not bad and really cheap considering the location",en
63.24,1,"A service charge of 15% or more will be added!
And
Be careful about paying during ""service hours""！

Even if they can't help adding 15% to the tax and service charge, they will also charge you money for the free service drink until you realize it.
Both the previous payment and the payment before that, the customers paid while feeling uncomfortable with the payment.

If you keep doing that, you'll be called Vietnam a country of rip-offs.",en
63.25,5,We had chicken burgers which were good. Plenty in them & a small side dish of fries picked vegetables. Service was good & beers were cold. Plenty of options to choose from. I would go again,en

63.27,1,"Had sign out front saying the specials for the day, which was half the price listed on the menu. When I got the bill they charged me full price and when I tried to correct them they said they were no longer doing the special price even though this wasn’t listed anywhere and they didnt let me know when I ordered my meal. Food was also dry and tasteless. Avoid",en

63.73,5,Mind blowing Hong Kong seafood noodles with great service,en
63.74,2,Can't pour a beer at all. All Staff need training. Almost half head half beer. Also got our order wrong even though we pointed at the specific pizza we wanted. Prices are pretty average as well. Once we got every thing it wasn't even that tasty anyway. They were apologetic and the right order come out 15 mins later.,en
63.75,2,"Solidly subpar food and service.

The staff members spent more time socializing at their own table than serving customers.  There was a table across the way with three other staff members (the same that took our order) drinking beer and having fun while we struggled to get some aassistance..

As for the food, we ordered bbq pork tips, which would be more accurately described as steamed pork with cheap BBQ sauce slathered on it. It had zero grill flavor.  Really disappointing.  We also ordered something called ""mexican quesodilla"" despite having very little cheese in it. And for the four segments we got which were quite small) it came with one tiny dish overly sweet (clearly canned) salsa.  Hardly enough for eating with one slice of quesadilla much less all four.

Additionally we had grilled fish (red snapper) that came out lukewarm and soggy rather than hot and crispy. The flavor was good but they let it sit around far too long before bringing it out to us.

Honestly the only thing we felt was up to the standards i am used to was the fried potato wedges. They were crispy and hot. Unfortunately they weren't paired with an accompanying sauce other than the Mayonnaise and ketchup we already had at our table.

Overall i would not recommend this place.",en

Tôi không thể không đề cập đến dịch vụ karaoke tại nhà hàng, nơi bạn có thể hát và giải trí cùng bạn bè và gia đình.
Ngoài ra, không gian thú vị của Thoáng Việt còn có chú hề tạo hình bong bóng. Chúng tôi đã được chứng kiến những biểu diễn tuyệt vời và thú vị từ chú hề này. Anh ấy không chỉ giúp tạo niềm vui và sự cười đùa trong tiệc, mà còn mang lại những tràng cười và sự thích thú cho cả trẻ em và người lớn.
Tổng kết lại, Nhà hàng Thoáng Việt là một địa điểm không thể bỏ qua cho các sự kiện như tiệc cưới và sinh nhật.

66.40,5,"Review về sinh nhật cháu mình 1 tuổi hôm chiều th7 (27/11) (Gò Vấp) vừa qua:
Về ngoại cảnh:
- Vị trí dễ tìm bãi gửi xe rộng rãi,
- Không gian nhà hàng không quá lớn hay sang trọng nhưng tạo bầu không khí bên trong rất ấm cúng, giá cả phải chăng, góc trang trí lưu niệm dành cho (nhân vật chính) bé được bố trí rất cute và bắt mắt. Có điều sân khấu hơi nhỏ và không có điểm nhấn.
- Mình nghĩ chỗ nhà banh ở bên ngoài nếu có thể chủ đầu tư thì thiết kế lại thành phòng chờ hay phòng trang trí chứ mình biết nhà banh rất khó vệ sinh và đơn nhiên là không được sạch sẽ cho lắm cho các bé chơi.
Về ẩm thực:
- Đồ ăn không quá ngon nhưng cũng vừa miệng và khẩu vị của nhiều người đặc biệt là số lượng đồ ăn trong 1 phần tương đối nhiều đảm bảo không lo khách tối về nấu mì gói ăn.
Về phục vụ:
- Mình rất hài lòng và đánh giá cao với thái độ của các bạn nhân viên ở đây rất lễ phép và ăn nói rất dễ thương thậm chí mình mới nhìn mắt và chuẩn bị hỏi thì nhân viên liền chạy lại và hỏi mình cần gì. Với phong cách phục phục như vậy các bạn chắc chắn sẽ thành công trong cuộc sống. Bữa chị nhà mình quên tiền tips xin lỗi các bạn nha T_T
- Chú hề rất tích cực thổi bong bóng cho các bé chơi và thổi không ngừng nghỉ, thổi với cường độ cao.
Nhà vệ sinh :
- Tương đối ổn
Chắc chắn sẽ quay lại và giới thiệu bạn bè khi có dịp. Chúc mọi người một ngày tốt lành.",vi

Khi sử dụng các dịch vụ tại Thoáng Việt, bạn sẽ chẳng cần phải lo nghĩ bất cứ điều gì nữa. Tất cả mọi thứ đều được đội ngũ nhân viên thực hiện hoàn hảo từ A đến Z. Bạn sẽ không phải tất bật chạy hết cửa hàng nọ đến cửa hàng kia để tìm mua dây trang trí,banner, hì hục bơm căng những trái bóng để treo lên,hay phải dọn dẹp sạch sẽ bãi chiến trường sau khi bữa tiệc kết thúc.
Buổi tiệc thôi nôi được sinh động , vui vẻ và đáng nhớ hơn khi nhà hàng Thoáng Việt  có thêm các dịch vụ đi kèm như MC chú hề, các hoạt động vui chơi cho các bé năng động, các phần quà cho các bé khi tham gia trò chơi ..

Staffs did not care the customer, may be because we came there as couple, only 2 people. Foods tastes so so bad, and they were still raw.
They did NOT inform the customer that the price named in menu was for only 100gram and they automatically set the minimum for each dish was 300gram or more without asking customer. To get more money from me, I guess.

I was so supprise once I got the bill on hand.

The quality is not deserved with the amount of money I pay.

Tiếng anh gà chứ cũng phải viết tiếng anh cho mấy vị nc ngoài cũng né ra vì gần khu vực sân bay.
Còn cho a chị em bạn dì nè, né quán này ra. Đồ ăn dở ơi là dở, thịt dê thì dai, nhai về hôm sau nghỉ đi làm luôn vì còn ê cái đầu :))
Vô menu ghi giá chứ ko ghi rõ là giá/100gram. Cũng ko hỏi khách là ăn bao nhiêu gram. Auto quất zô 3 lạng. Mà mình thấy nếu cân lên chắc chắn được hẳn 2 lạng hơn :v. Tính tiền như đúng rồi z á. Thui, né né ra mấy bạn ei. Mắc mà ngon thì ko nói. Mắc mà dở mà còn gặp dạng buôn bán ko rõ ràng, chán hẳn. 1 đi không trở lại (ai mời đi quán này thì thôi để mình dành trả tiền, mà trả tiền ở quán khác á :)) )",

Lúc order ko hỏi khách ăn bao nhiêu gram. Với kinh nghiệm đi chợ nấu ăn của mình thì 1 phần thịt trong món như vậy ko thể nào 300gr :))
Đồ ăn nhạt nhẽo ko ngon, nước lẩu như nước lã. Lẩu dê tươi mà ăn tưởng canh rau mồng tơi nấu nêm bột nêm.
Thịt dê trong lẩu thì thì 0.5 phần da 9.5 phần thịt.
Thịt dê của món dê hấp tía tô cứng ngắc (đa phần cũng toàn da dê ko chứ ko có thịt dê tươi).

Dê xào ngon, 1 dĩa 100k khá nhiều, tuy nhiên lẩu dê thì phần cái, tức là mấy đồ trong nước lẩu như khoai môn, tàu hũ ky khá ít. Ăn không đã. Bánh phở cực kỳ ít, rau phải kêu thêm và tất cả những gì ăn thêm đều tính tiền riêng. Mặc dù nồi lẩu cũng gần 200k.
Nhiều nhân viên nhiệt tình, nhưng cũng có vài cô ""mặt như mẹ thiên hạ"", khách vào ăn uống mà kêu không thèm nghe, làm lơ. Đưa đồ không thèm nói một câu.

Quán lộ thiên, thoáng khí, không bị ám khói.

Các món dê chế biến vừa ăn.
Bên trên là nhận xét ngay lần đầu tới quán, và dưới đây là lần thứ 2.

Lần thứ hai vào quán, tôi có 1 phát hiện mới muốn chia sẻ với các bạn. Thiết nghĩ trong quá trình sơ chế và chế biến món ăn, quán nào cũng có sơ sót. Nhưng quan trọng là thái độ và cách xử lý với khách hàng của quán dê Lam Sơn quá kém.
Mời các bạn xem hình và thử nghĩ món ăn có dây kẽm của miếng bùi nhùi rửa chén và các bạn phục vụ trả lời là: "" Tụi em ko biết!"" ""Không có quản lý ở đây!"" Các bạn trả lời kiểu khinh khỉnh, cho qua chuyện; như chúng tôi muốn ăn không trả tiền. Vấn đề ở chỗ muốn góp ý, để quán khắc phục. Nhân viên xử sự như vậy, thiết nghĩ chủ quán cũng không kém.

You would think since the prices are higher they might give thicker slices of sushi but it’s still thin. They are at times double the price of Hokkaido Sushi yet 10% of the quality of food and service. I had to ask for Wasabi over 3 times. Also, I told them I would order for the family but they tried to be sneaky and ask each person and recommended only expensive dishes. I don’t blame the stuff, I blame the manager/owners who clearly train their staff to recommend overpriced food. Portions are small compared to the price. I regret taking my father and relatives to this restaurant. When we arrived we had 3 servers but after the order only one server helped us. Also we ask them to take a picture and they passed on the duty to another. Overall, if you want a high quality experience, I would avoid this restaurant. I doubt it’ll survive long term.",

- Nhân viên không hiểu món trên hoá đơn là ghi gì..

Nên cải thiện rất nhiều nếu muốn đúng tiêu chí nhà hàng sushi.
Nhân viên là sinh viên, nhiều người mà không biết sắp xếp công việc.
Nói thật như vậy không thể thu tiền service charge vì service quá tệ.

Nghe tên thì thấy tương đối ổn.

Tiệc trên 30 bàn gộp 2 sảnh. Chắc vì vậy mà có nhiều thứ còn thiếu.

Nhà hàng tiếp đón khách cũng chưa chuyên nghiệp, tiệc tới 30 bàn mà không có thông tin chỉ dẫn từ phía ngoài.
Đợi nhận viên lại bàn để phục vụ cũng lâu lắc. Chắc thiếu nhân sự

Vào một ngày cuối tuần mình và cả gia đình muốn tới nhà hàng ăn buffet với nhau. Nó là một ngày vui khi câu phản hồi từ nhân viên khi nhà mình hỏi "" buffet nhà hàng sao lại đánh dấu chọn món"" bạn nhân viên nữ xinh xắn phản hồi lại rằng: "" nhà hàng em bán theo phong cách Hàn, nên bán kiểu đó, mình chọn món r mang lên hết kêu mang tiếp"". Vì cái chữ đó làm tâm trạng không vui rồi. Nhà mình hỏi nhà hàng bán theo món có gì, thì trả lời hơi ngắn gọn "" ở trong menu là những món nhà hàng bán"". Thật lòng vẫn chưa để ý quá nhiều, nhưng nhất quá tam

Tuy nhiên, khi phụ nữ lựa món ăn khá lâu, chờ ghi món lâu bạn ấy có nhờ 1 bạn khác rồi bảo. Ngồi chờ ghi món chắc cả ngày, thì lúc này mình hết nói rồi ạ.
Nói chung chắc do mình xui nên gặp bạn tiếp phục vụ bàn chưa được tốt. Dù gì Dìn ký cũng làm ăn uy tín lâu năm rồi, bữa ăn ta nói cũng hợp khẩu vị.",

This place is a little overwhelming to me but you may like it!
A pot of tea for 2 is range from 250-500/ every one else is 100k+. No more tea leaf even if you pay more money so if you go with bit group better to order more tea pot to choose bigger options!
A very nice place in the middle of Tan Binh District!",
84.2,5,"This restaurant is situated in the heart of a upscale square not far from the airport. It is a favorite hangout for upscale buddhist vegetarian food lovers.
The vibe is a mix of zen, luxury, and modernity. Every table provides a peaceful place to enjoy teas and delicious vegetarian dishes. We did not make a reservation. We parked and entered over a small bridge shaded by a huge mango tree full of fruit. We were welcomed straight to a table along a thematic wall of hand painted white lotus. The restaurant has been recently remodeled. Downstairs is for dining while upstairs is all about tea and zen.
The menu offers a wide variety of delicious and health conscious starters and main courses that non vegetarians will enjoy. My friend did all the ordering so I’m not sure what each plate was called. All were exquisite, light and delicious. Súp hầu thủ was my favorite dish. The mushrooms in this soup are very special. Make sure to try the longan fruit with lotus seed for desert.

Everything we ate was fresh and delicious. The chefs use the best quality ingredients to produce dishes that are simply delightful. The restaurant also offers a wonderful drink menu, and they offer one of the best tea selections in the region. The teas are surely worth sampling.
The service was great. It seemed to me that the waiters were engaged and interested in their jobs. The owner seemed very warm and cultured.
I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is serene.
If you like Hum… this place is worth visiting and not so expensive.",
84.3,4,"A lovely vegetarian place with nice ambiance and service.
I tried the mix plate of starters and the Rice noodles ""Singapore style"". Both dishes were delicious, specially the last one. And don't miss out the fresh and healthy juices!
Recommended 😃",
84.4,1,"We went there for breakfast. We saw a sign outside that said they had noodle soup for 40k-50k.
Once we were seated inside we ordered a bowl each, but were forced to order a drink. They said we must order ""combo"".
We ended up paying double. It feels unfair and a complete rip off. NEVER AGAIN!!",
84.5,1,I think this restaurant is over rated. They seemed to be in a hurry and not really focused on the customers. The food was average considering the pletora of delicious food that there is everywhere in Ho chi min. From district 1 it takes at least 30minutes because the traffic is really crazy. Not worth the visit.,
84.6,5,peaceful place. I had to come here twice before leaving VN. a must try restaurant.,
84.7,4,"Everything we had was delicious, beautifully presented, and very healthy. I would give them 5 stars but the food seems really expensive for vegetarian ingredients. We spent about 500k on lunch for 2.",
84.8,1,"The food here is some of the saddest, most miserable I've ever been served in Vietnam.

I am a long time vegan, and have lived in HCMC and other places in the country for years.
I thought I've seen it all, but here they surprised me with a bite-sized portion of fresh rolls (costing 90k!),
And a noodle dish that looked and tasted like it was cooked by a kid.

The atmosphere and decoration is good, so if you just come here for a drink and sit with people / with your laptop,
it might be acceptable.
But don't order any food, there are hundreds of cheaper and better restaurants around.

I don't believe any of those past reviews with high ratings, there's something fishy about it.",
84.9,1,"Pretentious. Bad service, waiters were only focused on one group, while ignoring others.
I guess this was once a well run restaurant that has changed owners or staff.
Food is Okay, but nothing special compared to other restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City. Small portions. Definitely don't order the sushi, and don't be misled by the pictures in the menu.
There are many other restaurants that offer better value, so it's not worh the the detour.

No idea where those 5 star ratings come from.",
84.10,5,Nice place to eat vegan and tea,
84.11,5,"The food is various in range and tasty yet a little too much oil to my taste. Nice decor and zen music, subtle environment. The price is from 100k to 200k per dish.",

--------------------------------------------------

Hôm nay mình ghé Chay Muni lần 2 mới dám chia sẻ vì lần trước vô tình đói bụng quá trùi sau cuộc họp thì Duyên Lành đưa bước chân mình và bạn Sếp ghé quán này thưởng thức món chay ngon miệng quên lối về - nên sợ chia sẻ không chính xác.
(đói quá mầm đá còn ngon mà!😂🤣)

Trưa nay, ghé quán này bụng không đói để xem thử còn cái cảm giác ngon miệng như lần trước không?

Kết quả?

Mỗi món ăn vẫn là bản giao hưởng của màu sắc an yên, hòa quyện mùi hương thuần khiết nhẹ nhàng của rau củ đẩy vị giác tò mò khám phá dần sự tinh tế, cân bằng hương vị trong từng món ăn ngon tại đây !👍

Phần lớn rau củ quả đều organic chế biến cùng các loại nấm thượng hạng với tay nghề đầu bếp điêu luyện đã giúp bữa ăn chay trở nên thanh tao hơn.

Bước qua cánh cổng gỗ Muni là 1 hồ nước nho nhỏ, cây xanh che bóng mát, không gian thanh tịnh xen lẫn lâu lâu ngân vang tiếng chuông gió trong trẻo như tiếng suối xa mát rượi chảy về làm dịu mát tâm hồn chúng ta! 🌬🌨
(Mình chưa bao giờ nghe tiếng chuông gió nào hay & an yên như ở đây)

Cuối cùng, các bạn nhân viên ở Chay Muni nếu dễ thương số 2 thì cả Sài Gòn khó tìm ra quán/ nhà hàng nào số 1 á!😍👍

Cảm ơn Duyên May ở Chay Muni !

Kì tới mình nhất định sẽ ngồi lầu 2 Muni để thưởng trà vì đây là quán trà đạo của 1 vị Trà Sư trứ danh Việt Nam.
Vạn sự Tùy Duyên...🌸💖💜",

Đồ ăn khá ngon, thịt k bị mùi như những quán khác mình từng ăn mình vote món nầm heo và ba chỉ bò st ngon ... Vì là buffet gọi món nên là các bạn có nhắc phụ thu khi để lại đồ thừa và không cho trả món khi đã oder nhằm để chất lượng thịt tốt nhất cho mọi người. Rate 5 ✨ . Lần sau sẽ ghé cùng gia đình. Mọi người nhớ thử kem nhé",

87.10,1,"Giá vé buffet: 300k/người
Quán chỉ phù hợp với nhóm 2-3 người. Đông hơn thì KHÔNG NÊN đến. Quán cần cải thiện:
- Sàn nhà dầu mỡ, trơn trượt. Không gian kín, ám khói, nóng nực.
- Bàn và không gian bé xíu. Mình đi 10 người lớn, sắp xếp 2 bàn, giơ tay giơ chân đụng nhau bôm bốp. Thêm nữa, bàn bé nhưng chén dĩa bưng món lên qtqđ, nên gom lại 1 dĩa lớn cho gọn
- Phục vụ: ngơ ngác, chậm chạp, không buồn quan sát xem khách có cần mình không. Dù lượng nhân viên phục vụ khá đông nhưng rất chán! Dịch vụ CỰC KÌ chậm!
- Khách tự viết giấy gọi món nhưng đưa nhân viên vẫn sót. Bàn 10 người mà nhân viên cứ sợ khách ăn không hết bị phạt, trong khi mình gọi chục lần full giấy order vẫn chưa no.
- Mới 19h mà quán báo hết rất nhiều món và ngưng phục vụ các món đó.
- Đồ ăn: đông lạnh là chủ yếu. Ướp sốt không phân biệt được sự khác nhau.
- Quầy line: nên sang bằng quầy line và đặt thêm bàn. Đồ ăn hết, rau hết, muỗng hết, đũa hết cũng không buồn châm thêm.
- Tủ kem: để cho đẹp, hết kem quán cũng không fill thêm.
- Ưu điểm duy nhất: nhà vệ sinh

Chốt 1 chữ: CHÊ. Mong chủ quán đọc được bình luận này mà cải thiện dịch vụ và đào tạo lại nhân viên ❤️",

89.1,4,"Great restaurant for causal meal!
I have eaten here three times this week.
One lunch with the Tofu soup , a dinner with the Ginseng chicken.
Tonight I tried the pork belly BBQ as well as an order of the deep fried shrimp.
They were all served with 9 little dishes of the Korean style.
Food are not top class of course but are all delicious.😋😋😋
It is an excellent place for casual meal with friends. Price are absolutely reasonable and service is perfect! 👍👍👍
No VAT and no service charge!😁😁😁
The Korean boss is nice and so are the waitresses👏👏👏They are so attentive and helpful.
I will come more often…..",
89.2,1,"Reasonable price for K BBQ, meat isn’t that great but it’s doable considering this is one of the less crowded restaurants in the area.

However, the real issue is the staff. I was triple charged after eating here. I immediately called the restaurant to ask them to check if they received the funds (per instructions from my bank). The girl answering the phone didn’t even bother to check, but told me straight away that “oh we didn’t triple charge you?” Whereas I saw them swiped my card multiple times because the machine ran out of paper, but they only gave me one receipt to sign. I called them a few more times after waiting for a few weeks, that I didn’t receive my refund but the staff insisted that they didn’t do anything wrong.

Long story short, had to wait 90 days (over Tet holidays) for my bank to file a dispute with Visa and I finally won. No matter how good the food is, we won’t be back. There are so many things could’ve been done to avoid all this (told me straight away BEFORE you swipe my cards 2 more times, put me on hold while you check with your bank if the funds went through, following ups, etc.) but all radio silence from the owner/ restaurant altogether.",
89.3,5,Excellent food and reasonable price. Food was traditional Korea cooking. 🥰 …,
89.4,5,One of the best authentic Korean restaurants I have been to..really good food and value for money. Their spicy stir-fried octopus is a must try. Also their side dishes are really good.,

89.13,1,Nhân viên phục vụ rất tệ. Quán hơi đông tuy nhiên chỉ tập trung phục vụ người Hàn. Nếu quán không phục vụ người Việt thì nên để thông báo ở ngoài để khách biết mà không vào. Chứ đũa không đủ hỏi cũng rất lâu. Chờ đồ nương hay bất cứ thứ gì thì dù gọi nhân viên nhiều lần cũng rất lâu mới xử lý,
89.14,5,"Nhà hàng hàn quốc gần sân bay , đồ ăn ngon , nhân viên thân thiện , có ông chủ rất dễ thương.",

Các bạn nhân viên thì rất dễ thương và phục vụ tận tình úm, lúc mà chưa có món chính, mình ăn vơi một vài banchan trên bàn ak là các bạn lại hỏi mình có muốn ăn thêm hong để các bạn lấy, làm mình rất vui về điều đó và chủ quán ở đó cũng rất dễ thương nữa, ông chủ là người Hàn nhưng nói chuyện bằng tiếng việc với tụi mình nhiều úm.

89.34,1,"I just went.
I ordered Galbitang Seafood and Green Onion Pancakes, but the food comes out in 30 minutes. I got green onion pancakes and tempura, but there was no soy sauce, so I asked for it and got it in 10 minutes. Side dishes are not enough. I refilled the side dish and it was served 20 minutes later.
Except for edibles, they only refill kimchi. I complained to the boss.

90.9,1,"Mình xin được nói về cảm nhận của bản thân mình khi đi ăn tại đây:
- Đầu tiên, quán không có chỗ giữ xe, xe tự đậu ở bên hông quán mà mình không thấy ai giữ cả, cũng không lấy thẻ xe
- Thứ hai, không gian quán xanh như tên quán nhưng không được rộng cho lắm, quán sử dụng quạt, không có máy lạnh, mình thấy có tầm 7 bàn, từ 2-4 người/ bàn. Ngồi tâng trên mà thấy có ai đi qua lại là sàn rung lắc hơi sợ.
- Tiếp theo, là phần đồ ăn, đây là phần làm cho mình thất vọng nhất trong ngày hôm nay, mình thấy chất lượng món ăn không đi đôi với giá cả, phải nói là đắt so với chất lượng:
+ Thấy mọi người đánh giá là gỏi nấm mối ngon nên mình cũng gọi, nhưng mà lên món thì nấm mối mini bé tí, không có gì ngoài xà lách, cà rốt, dưa leo bào sợi, 4 cái bánh phồng và 1 chén nước sốt nhỏ nhưng theo mình thấy món này không có gì đặt sắc cả, hơi ngọt, và không thấy vị nấm mối đâu cả.
+ Tiếp theo mình định gọi chả giò trái cây, tưởng đâu được ăn thì một lúc lâu sau, quán mới báo hết thế là mình đổi sang món Bún gạo lứt. Thất vọng tập hai ạ. Chờ hoài mà món không lên nên mình có hỏi bạn phục vụ thì bạn ấy nói là bún đang nấu cho mềm. Nhưng lúc lên món thì gắp tầm 2 đũa là hết. Món này siêu nhạt, Ngoài bún thì có cả cà rốt, đậu và 2 miếng bông cải nhỏ.
+ Lẩu thái 2 người ăn nhưng ít so với giá quán đưa ra, vài miếng nấm bào ngư xám nhỏ xíu, vài miếng đậu hủ và cà chua. Rau thì tươi xanh nhưng rất đắt, bún rất ít. Vị thì cũng nhạt nốt. Rau thêm 55k nhưng không có nấm, chỉ có vài cọng mồng tơi, cải thìa và cải thảo. Nói chung rất thất vọng.
+ Nha đam hạt chia uống ổn, hơi ngọt, nha đam tươi
+ Cơm chiên xanh khá ổn, cơm màu xanh tạo hình trái tim, có cà rốt, vài loại đậu, hạt điều, 2 miếng bông cải nhỏ. Khá là nhạt nhưng ổn nhất trong nhưng món mình ăn ở đây
- Về thái độ phục vụ của nhân viên, mình thấy bàn mình đến trước, gọi món thì lên rất lâu, lên từng món, nhưng mình thấy bàn sau đến sau, gọi món thì lên 1 lần 2 món, nhanh hơn cả mình. Nhân viên không niềm nở cho lắm. Mình cũng hiểu là mấy bạn bận nhưng cũng phải cần sắp xếp hợp lý hơn.
Còn nói về việc quay lại hay không, thì câu trả lời của mình là không nha.
Cảm ơn mọi người đã đọc",
90.10,4,"Đồ ăn vừa miệng ok, quán có nước gừng xả free uống ngon, không gian quán nhỏ , trên lầu trang trí tất cả đều màu xanh, có phòng kính riêng biệt, góp ý là món gỏi quán để bánh phòng tôm cũ nên ăn mềm èo à. Nhân viên phục vụ nhiệt tình",

tính ra thời điểm đó món nước duy nhất có là lẫu nấm. Quán ngồi trên lầu lửng nên đi đứng có nghe tiếng kêu hơi khó chịu, thức ăn ko được đa dạng, đa số món khô ko có món nước. Mình order món mì ý sốt nấm cà chua thì ko đúng thật sự là mì ý. Còn gỏi thì cũng bắp cải, salad và carot sắc

Đến phần nhận xét món ăn, OMG 😱, chỉ cần ngồi và rút điện thoại ra quét mã QR code đã hiện lên trên mắt tôi rồi thiệc là hiện đại 🥳. Tôi có chọn 1 phần gỏi nấm mối, đậu hủ xá xíu, lẩu thái 2 người. Thiệc sự nhìn bắt mắt và ăn rất no khi đi 2 người.
Và cuối cùng tôi và bạn chúc nhà hàng luôn thành công, luôn phát triển nhé",

Mình có góp ý về phục vụ, nhưng không hẳn lỗi của 2 bạn phục vụ nữ vì 2 bạn rất nhẹ nhàng ân cần chu đáo với khách mà là do quán chưa chỉn chu lắm trong khâu chuẩn bị. Ví dụ menu cũ mới lẫn lộn, hoặc trong menu ghi cơm chiên có hạt điều nhưng bưng ra là đậu phộng. Hũ bánh biscotti trên kệ có nhiều kiến bên trong v.v.
Mình thấy tiếc vì nếu quán quan tâm đến tiểu tiết thêm 1 chút thì sẽ hoàn hảo.

Lúc sau tự đi lên lầu thì thấy đầy bàn trống. Order xong 30p xong lên nói là order của mình bị rớt nước rồi order lại dùm. Order lại thì món nào cũng hết. Rồi bưng nồi lẩu ra để vậy 20p, chắc nấu chín r ăn thôi k cần bếp. Mình rất ít review gì nhưng lần này thì khá bực",

All the venues are clean, the food is delicious, and the toilets are hygienic.
However, it is hot because it is a large space or the air conditioning is not good.
Because it is located in the back of a narrow alley, it takes time to arrive even if you come close because the alley becomes crowded when multiple weddings are held. In addition, there is also the inconvenience that taxis do not come easily.",
92.5,4,"A good place for events, have been through VGS Offline, good but the air is so hot and the rest room is not that good, would give it a five star if there is a better parking lot, better toilet. Btw, this place is good choice for wedding, cosy and well cooked.

The thing that made me disappointed was, we had some spare door gifts that hadn't previously distributed so we had to pile them up at the corner of our venue for later distribution to late comers. By the end of the event, all were gone. Even ones who came earlier but left their seat for our activities came back complaining about their gifts disappeared. Turned out, some of the serving staffs took the remaining gifts and left them at the preparation room. We were able to recover some, but most got lost.
The gifts were not of high value, but had our company logo and looked cute. And after all, they were not theirs. So better training needed for staffs, otherwise it would bigger disaster for them later.",
92.16,1,"Parking area are crowded, waiting to long to get in, they are busy for charging people than help them to park their traffic. We got bad experience in the party, my friend didn't get food, really bad service. MC looked like speak in funeral  rather than a Wedding, he disragarded people.",
92.17,3,"Pros:
- Food is ok
- Nice decor
- Big place

Cons:
- They take parking fee first then you are allowed to park your bike
- Parking is surrounded with fences and they bonus steel chains. There is no free way to get out of the parking unless you climb over the chains.
- All wedding halls are connected with only one hallway so that it is very crowded",

96.6,5,The food is awesome!! And the owner is quite friendly...offered us complementary water and desserts.,
96.7,1,"Very Bad Experience. Me and two of my friends visited the restaurant yesterday and it seems like we disturbed them by visiting there.

1. Waiter arrived after 5 minutes
2. Food arrived after 30-45 minutes
3. Soup was served to us which bought from outside
4. Wall Fans were full of black dust hanging just above our plates. When asked, arrogantly said we will take care next time.

Sorry to visit your restaurant and sorry to disturb you all. Seems your main focus is something different than running restaurant.",
96.8,4,"Very tasty and authentic Northern Indian food. It has a large menu and we the chicken Tikka masala, aloo saag paneer, mutton curry, fish masala. And the Naan which is banned perfectly in their oven. The prices are reasonable and service was good. But it took quite a while for our food to come out. The dining room was a little drab but the food is so good you won't even notice. It's just around the corner from the Superbowl. One thing I have an issue with their dishes - too oily. Tell them to tone down the oil.",
96.9,1,My guests didn’t like the taste. I myself didn’t like the taste at all. Serving time was long and forgot the naan to serve. Not coming here ever.,
96.10,1,"Seekh kebab totally dry, dal makhni seemed to be the frozen one. Totally disappointing!",
96.11,1,We give up to wait after waiting more than an hour for “set menu”,
96.12,5,Found this one to be an authentic Indian restaurant. We ordered nans with dhal and chicken 65. Found the bill to be bit expensive.,
96.13,5,"Great service, guy went out to get a beer that was not on the menu! Delicious meal! Perfect when you are tired of Vietnamese food.",
96.14,5,"Amazing place! Simple,, humble restaurant serving very tasty Indian food. The Biryanis were mouth watering delicious, portion size generous and the best part was the prompt and efficient service by the lady in charge. Do not be fooled by the simplicity of this place. Tasty Indian food, very courteous service and extremely reasonable prices make me want to visit again! Tops in value for money. Highly recommended.",
96.15,1,"we aren't happy with your delivery.

1. You didn't send any chutney/sauce with the samosa. Who does that? Being an Indian it's such a bad show of service.

2. The butter chicken had old tandoor chicken in it and the gravy was so light and such a weird color, somebody definitey needs to learn how to make butter chicken. Very disappointed, we didn't even eat the whole thing. Hope the chicken you used was fresh, because you said that the tandoor is not working still there was tandoor chicken in the gravy.

3. No salad with the food, a little cut onions or pickle would have been nice.

My friends only liked the parantha, i'm sorry to say very disappointed, no wonder why people don't order from you, cause you treat your customers this way. Especially Indians. Sad. Will never order again.",
96.16,1,"Bad experience, waited for 1 hour food not come!",
96.17,5,Excellent place for Indian food... It fit my Vietnamese taste tooooo,
96.18,5,"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vietnam. The food is delicious and reasonably priced, the atmosphere is nice and quiet, and above all the staff is great. Thuy and Hoang are really sweet and Dinesh is an awesome guy, super friendly waiter. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for yummy food and awesome service! 🥰

-Jess",
96.19,5,"It's a quiet restaurant, standard decor, and has pleasant and attentive staff.
The authenticity of the place has me hooked. The flavours, smells, and textures of the food transported me back to India- I was a fully satisfied customer and will be back many times to come i think.",
96.20,4,"Very delicious food and service. Highly recommend this place for authentic Indian food. The pictures are affordable when it comes to international foods in Vietnam. They can accommodate for vegans too, just ask for your vegetarian dish without butter/ghee and yogurt. I got a Channa Masala (chickpea dish) and a chapati for 105,000 vnd (about 4.50 usd).",
96.21,3,I have knowledge about Indian food. It can be much better. But in Saigon vietnamese don't have knowledge about Indian food.  So it's okay. Spice India can do better.  I go there because they serve halal. Thanks for that,
96.22,4,Decent food. Very near to HCM airport. If you are craving for some Indian food then this is the place to go. Ordered their sea food thali and it is worth the money. Fish is soft and nice. The gravy also taste's good.,
96.23,4,This place had changed to a new address. Now it's next to the Vinmart and on the same side of the SUPER BOWL shopping center. Service is a bit slow they don't pay attention much. The food is OK. It's an oasis for Indian food lovers because it's the only one in that area and survives without any competition from same kind of Indian restaurants.,
96.24,5,The best place to eat Indian food in Saigon!,
96.25,1,"Honestly, found the owner rude. That's not how you speak to guests in your restaurant when they ask for your advice on your menu items.",
96.26,5,"It is best the Indian restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam.",
96.27,5,"It's a very good place, the lassi didn't taste as lassi, bur it was ok. The food on the other hand was very good, the staff is very attentive and they speak english as well so, overall was a very good experience. I would recommend you to try the Chicken Korma :)",
96.28,5,"Located at walkable distance from Tan Son Nhat International airport, this Indian restaurant serves good Indian veg/non-veg dishes and also serves Beer/Cold-drinks.
My try -outs : Chicken Biryani, Anna-Sambar, Curd Rice. Biryani and Anna-Sambar were really good, curd rice could have been skipped. And yes its a budget friendly one.",

96.32,5,"Great food, reasonable prices, but service can be slow.  Convenient to the airport and northern Saigon.  Everything we had was awesome.",
96.33,1,"Very fair taste, worst ever attitude. Please don’t order online as the bill will be more than what expected, and argument towards money. Simply - not for taste, only for money..",

96.148,5,"Một nhà hàng đổi gió thú vị, hương vị Ấn rất đậm gia vị. Có thể gọi suất suất Thali 129-149k/ phần để thử 3 món curry, kèm bánh nan và cơm hạt basmati. Thấy bàn anh/ chị Ấn kia kêu Buttermilk, nhưng uống không thấy hợp khẩu vị lắm :).

Cô nhân viên gợi ý dùng tay ăn thử, nhưng vẫn không quen nên dùng muỗng :D

Xác nhận là quán chuẩn bị đồ ăn khá lâu, hơn 30p mới có món. Tuy nhiên đồ ăn ra món hổi. Không gian nhà hàng rộng rãi, thoải mái, có máy lạnh.

Rất nên thử khi có tiện thời gian, muốn trải nghiệm văn hoá",

Hi, Chai seems to be the authentic taste.

It was real Indian curry.
Rather south.
An Indian said it, so there is no doubt.",
96.151,3,"The main customer base is staff at the nearby airport and Indians living nearby. Like an Indian restaurant, there are a lot of menu items, but if you look at the pictures and English descriptions, it seems like the food, and the curry can get confused like the curry. There is a set menu, but this is not recommended. The amount used by the Korean army 20 years ago was not autonomously served on the food tray, but served as a feeling of being forced to serve a small amount under the excuse of lack of supply. For the set menu, curry can be selected from lamb/chicken/seafood. On future visits, I plan to ignore the set and try again as a single item. It looks like there are two Indian chefs in the kitchen. The mutton curry's lamb was softer than I thought, and the curry was also soft ^^;;;; When ordering a set, 2 pieces of large Plain Naan are served along with Steamed Rice. I can't eat rice after eating this. There was a lot of naan, but I dipped it in the curry, so I didn't have enough curry to mix with rice. Hen. The tandoori chicken served on the plate was softer than expected, but the taste was too light. Lassi was delicious.

96.159,5,Super nice staff who speak excellent English. About 10 minutes walk from the airport in HCMC. The best naan bread I've ever eaten. The other dishes were all delicious too. I felt comfortable and would come again!,
96.160,5,"pretty tasty...

If you go to Dongdaemun Station on Line 1, there are many Nepalese and Indian restaurants.
The price is somewhat similar

Yang is 1.5 times more satisfied with Seoul...",

97.2,3,"Fair to say that the food quality is average this is to compare with other restaurants of the same standards. The service is also just average. What disappointed me was the availability of dishes, there aint much to order for dim sum and the portion of roast-meat-dishes is much less for the double price you pay. It's not bad, but I can definitely and easily find better options.",
97.3,4,"Located on the second floor of the Tan Son Nhat hotel, this Dim Tu Tac location can get quite packed. Service is good and tables are turned fairly quickly compared to other locations. However, the food quality is not as good as the Hoang Van Thu location near the Sheraton. The food is good, but it can be better. We were seated promptly but the wait on the food can get slow in between dishes. Overall, good service and good food",
97.4,1,"It's honestly baffling to me that this restaurant has received such positive reviews with such basic comments like ""good"" or ""delicious."" Don't be fooled by these seemingly glowing reviews - they couldn't be further from the truth.

First off, the restaurant is located in a shabby, rundown 3-star hotel, and the decor is outdated and unappealing. The restroom is downright filthy and unsanitary, so if you're looking for a clean dining experience, this is not the place for you.

Even worse than the lackluster atmosphere is the quality of the food. Despite the exorbitant prices, the portions are minuscule and definitely not worth what they charge. I mean, the prices are on par with what you'd expect in the US, which is ridiculous considering the subpar quality.

Now let's get to the actual food. The jasmine tea is disgustingly watered down and tastes like hot boiled water instead of tea. And don't even get me started on the dim sum. We ordered Har Kau, and the skin is so thick and flavorless that it might as well not even be there. And the fried noodles with seafood? Not only were they cold, but they were dripping with oil. When we asked the server why they were cold, they completely ignored us, which just adds insult to injury.

Save yourself the money and skip this forgettable place altogether. If you're looking for authentic and delicious dim sum, look elsewhere. Trust me, you'll thank me later.",
97.5,5,Delicious Chinese food here. Nice place for business lunch.,
97.6,5,Restaurant is clean and clear. All dishes are tasty especially Roasted Duck. My family and friends love this place. We always choose this place for special events.,
97.7,5,One of my must-go-to places whenever I'm in town. The food is amazing. Favourite is the  steamed rice rolls fried in xo sauce. I'd say it's just like eating in Hong Kong. Service is impeccable.,
97.8,2,"A chinese restaurant located near the airport. The food is ok, but they didn't train the staff well. When we ask why the food takes long time and there is hair in the food, the staff just take note and go away, no apologize or any action is taken. And this is just ruining your dining experience.",

We've come here times (2nd floor- 202 Hoang Van Thu) for the above mentioned points, however, the third time we found the price of a small vegetable dish (shiitake + asparagus) was so high (@250.000vnd) vs the price of a half of a Pecking Duck with 2 dishes (@400.000vnd). I am regretted for not taking photo of this vegetable dish. It was not worth enjoying it, highly recommend should not order the shiitake stirred with asparagus. The others are good (my own comments).",

It's on the second floor inside the hotel building, so don't panic if you can't see the sign.
The service is similar to other dimtuks, but the xiaolongbao taste is a bit lacking. Hagawu is delicious.

Quán rất rộng, bàn ăn lớn thích hợp đi nhóm đông người. Tuy nhiên hơi ồn.
Vịt quay Bắc Kinh thì phần da không được dòn, nhân viên cắt dính thịt hơi nhiêu nên cảm giác là không chuẩn lắm, và theo mình do cắt vào phần thịt nhiều nên bánh tráng cuốn bên ngoài bị mềm theo do bị ướt. Cầm miếng cuốn rất mềm. Mùi vị ổn.
Các món khác ăn tạm, không thực sự xuất sắc.
Cuối buổi có các món tráng miệng nhưng không đem ra, mà đợi khách hỏi mới đem ra, vì bên mình đã đi ăn nơi khác rồi nên biết có phần này. Phần tráng miệng ăn tạm chứ cũng ko ngon.

It is more like a food chain and not really authentic.They server a lot local food like Pho.

[Ambiente]
The store offers about 50 seats at the ground floor. You have to order directly and the front office and pay afterwards.

It was really cheap and not comparable to touristic prices. So if you are looking for a cheap diner you can go for it.

They serve so slow. After they forced me to order some extra options, which bring their more income. Then they delivered me the meals without those. But when they collect the cost, they still put on the bill all the extra optipns.
Other bad thing that they put extra charge for tax without notices.
The most thing was made me disappointed that the staff didn't give me the bill, the made me doubt that the staff took me higher cost than the bill shows. Means the staff stole some money from the guest.

The wait staff was slow to receive us, which was odd because we were the second and only customers in the place. It took two waiters to take our order, I speak both English and Vietnamese, but it seemed as though the staff was not paying attention as they got our order wrong.  We ordered kids meals, noodles, and pho with 1 drink. The flavour was mediocre at best. Not worth the prices. My son accidentally spilled some soup and I asked the staff for napkins...they said they didn’t have any... interestingly they said we could is the ones that were left at the table, the wet ones that they charge you extra for without telling people or first time travellers.  The sad part was they had the odacity to include a tip on to the bill. We ate as fast as our children’s sped would allow and left.  The whole time with the eyes of the wait staff staring, but not in a may we help you kind of way, I know this because I had to ask for the bill three times.  I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone.",

- Không gian quán: sạch sẽ, thoáng, mát. Quán được trang trí theo tông tím, nhìn ok.
- Phục vụ: đồ ăn lên lâu, chắc biết khách phải chờ lâu nên cửa hàng chuẩn bị cả trò sudoku cho khách chơi, thế mà mình giải xong ô rồi mà đồ vẫn chưa lên.huhu. Quán không dùng giấy ăn khô, khác gì bắt khách phải dùng giấy ướt và thế là mất thêm 5k.
- Ở đây 1 suất cơm tấm phải từ 80k trở lên, nhưng đúng là tiền nào của đấy:
+/ Miếng sườn: thịt ăn ngậm mồm, nạc. Thịt được tẩm ướp vừa phải, nướng vừa tới không bị khô, nhưng hôm đó có 1 suất bạn mình miếng sườn hơi cháy (trừ điểm).
+/ Cơm: theo như cách ăn ngoài Bắc mình thì hơi khô, có thể đây là cách ăn của miền Nam nên mình không đánh giá. Nhưng hơi ít cơm với sức con trai ăn.
+/ Chả trứng: đặc, ăn ok
+/ Bì: hơi cứng.
- Một điểm trừ nữa là quán có tính thêm VAT, nhưng mình có yêu cầu viết hóa đơn mà mãi không thấy gửi hóa đơn.",

103.6,1,"Staff here are untrained and running around like headless chickens. Waited for an order for about 25 minutes and witnessed them transferring food items from one bag to another constantly because they had no idea how to fulfill each order competently. I saw one staff run out to the front counter with a mcflurry in their hand exclaiming ""whose is this for"" whilst visibly showing confusion and lack of awareness or understanding on why they even made a mcflurry in the first place.",
103.7,4,Just another McDonald’s located inside airport. Spacious outside area but staffs seem to be confused. It’s not busy as before so serving time is quick. Use the app to get a lot of deals and promotions.,
103.8,5,Amazing friendly service and everything was fresh! Thank you,
103.9,1,Staffs don't bother to greet nor talk when I ordered. Food is terribly cold. Cannot hold a candle to the MacD of other countries.,
103.10,4,It's my first day here it's nice to start my day with great food just little confused about currency and language and I'm amazed to their different condiments,
103.11,3,They charged extra when adding mayonnaise to burger but had a pump for mayonaise outside. Not quite understand the logic of their pricing here.,
103.12,5,Delicious fast food for now after feeling so hungry... Close to the airport. The staffs are very friendly and they can speak English so I can ask what I need... :-),
103.13,5,Good and friendly staff. But quite slow in terms of fastfood. It takes 10 mins for this burger (egg + cheese),
103.14,1,Waited 15 minutes for a breakfast and they served me a half cooked egg,
103.15,5,"Food and staff is good. Mcfluri with oreo very nice. Air condition, good wifi.",
103.16,4,"Good location, good staff, good food except chips is not good (small, soft, not good quality potato).",
103.17,4,Lounge access purchase available which will pay for itself between food/drink/wifi/printing - all of which makes delays much easier to handle in a foreign country,
103.18,5,Price is affordable and friendly staffs,
103.19,3,"Easy to arrive by motorbike or car. Stay tight in line or you will have locals cut you in line. Personal space boundaries are different here compared to other cultures. Check in was fast. Security too. Restaurants were out of a lot of items, it was 9 pm. Other items expensive like most airports.",
103.20,5,"Near the domestic terminal, one of my favorite places to stop by before a flight. The food is always prepared fresh as you order it. That means filet of fish all day for me. In most places the filet of fish have been sitting around and so stale and old by the time you get it. Not here. Friendly staff and pretty fast. The dining area inside is small but they have seating in the patio if you don’t mind being outside.",

103.24,1,"Well, the food here is normal, the coca tasted really bad, but that wasn't the worst of my problem.
There was a mouse running in the restaurant, and he ran on me, and the staff weren't professional at all : just a little ""sorry"" from one waitress, no reduction, no commercial gesture, nothing.
Well I won't come back in any McDonals restaurant in Vietnam.",
103.25,4,"It is clean. It is fast. The employees can speak English. It is next to the Terminal.

This McDonald’s is a little bit hidden and you need to use Google if you want to know where it is located or ask someone. It is never overcrowded also this McDonalds is a very small one compared with the McDonalds in the City. I can recommend you the food here. It is well made like every McDonalds in Vietnam and has a better taste than I know in America or Europe. There are also “Terminals” (Monitor) where you can order your food on a computer without saying anything to the cashier.",
103.26,3,I was here from 6.30am . They said they will open at 7am . So I waited till 7am and hope I can catch some food before my flight . But they open at 7.04am :)),
103.27,3,"It opens 24/7, which is suitable for people arrive at the airport late. Food is cheap and delicious here. Howrver, there are fewer choices compare to some other McDonald’s in the city. Love it!!!",

103.32,4,Friendly staff. Restuarant was clean. The breakfast sandwich I had taste exactly like the US McDonald's. The only downside was the iced coffee. Sooo much ice. It was basically a cup of ice.,
103.33,3,Conveniently located next to the airport. Does not accept contactless payments at time of writing this. Staff are very helpful and polite.,

Secondly, the salmon sashimi that we ordered had a bone in it see the video. Although the theatrics looked cool, with the sashimi. thirdly, one of the barbecues in the table behind us the extractor fan had a high-pitched sound coming from it, which was really annoying down to the positives the nigiri was pretty good I really like the green tea. The California roll was interesting somethings I’ve never heard before would’ve given more stars if it hadn’t liked in those areas mentioned above.",

Basically it's the worst restaurant.",

Lúc đến nơi quán khá đông nhưng mình vẫn đc xếp chỗ ngồi, tuy nhiên gọi món mấy lần vẫn quên và ra rất rất chậm, bàn kế bên ăn gọi món thì lên khá nhanh. Mình đi 2 người, ngồi từ 7h30 đến 9h40 lên đc tầm 10 món, có lúc sushi bạch tuột còn đông lạnh chưa kịp rã đông 🤨🤨 Mình đã bỏ ra hơn 1 triệu để vô đây ngồi đợi, 10h quán đóng cửa mà 2 đứa vẫn ăn chưa no 😅😅",

Mình đi 2 người, chọn loại 529 ngàn/người, tổng thanh toán 1 triệu 250 ngàn.
Quan điểm của mình thì sasimi không được tươi, các loại cá nướng hơi khô, không hấp dẫn. Tuy nhiên những món phụ như salad, kem, sữa chua,… khá ngon.",
106.22,5,"Very cozy place. I read the reviews and as if they were writing about another restaurant, they were several times and the service was always very good. When we ordered a buffet, we had our own waiter who practically did not leave and constantly cleaned the plates, updated the water, and so on.

The food is delicious, the fish is fresh. In general, I recommend everyone to go and try it for yourself!",
106.23,5,"Thực đơn phong phú. Nhân viên phục vụ tốt. Các phần ăn tương đối ít, chỉ đủ cho 1 người, không share được với mọi người. Nhưng là buffet nên cũng ổn.",

Lên món thì thiếu, nhắc 1-2 lần vẫn không mang ra phải nhắc lần thứ 3 (nhắc nhiều quá người nhắc cũng ngại chứ 🙂)

There is a female manager, but she seems to hate Koreans. Even though I can't serve the tea, they serve food late and have some time. Food is ok. I'm in my mid-40s and I'm an employee, but I'm having a hard time.. They gave me food late.. I waited for an hour while eating. I said something later, I'm sorry. I'm so pour. It seems to be a repertoire. It seems that he speaks English too.. but it's a pity. Food is ok.",

Nhà hàng nên để ý đến nguyên liệu làm đồ ăn/ chất lượng đầu bếp. Các bạn thích yên tĩnh chút nên tránh các cuối tuần đông vì khách nhiều trẻ em, chạy ồn ào. Mình là khách thường xuyên của Golden Gate và Isushi ở nhiều nhà hàng khác nhau nhưng lần này ăn ở gần sân bay thấy thất vọng.",

Cá sống bị bở nát (không đủ tiêu chuẩn gọi để là sashimi), thịt bò nướng thì siêu dai.
Trà nóng (họ cho 1 túi lọc vô cái bình sứ) thì lạt hơn nước lã, ngửi kĩ lắm mới thấy 1 tí mùi trà

Giá vé 499k và 569k (chưa VAT)
khá cao nhưng do vật giá leo thang tạm chấp nhận được.
Phục vụ kém, bê nhầm món lên bàn mình nhưng mình ko biết ăn gần hết món thì nam quản lý lại nói em bê nhầm món và mang đi.
Giá vé nước 39k nhưng khi uống xong thì gọi châm nước hết người này đến người khác vẫn không bê lên.
Món ăn thì chậm.
Nói chung giá vé như vậy, mà phục vụ kém chỉ đáng 2*",

106.85,1,"Chiều tối 03/12/2021 lúc 18h00 tại isushi Trường, chúng tôi đặt bàn 08 người lớn 01 trẻ em 3 tuổi dưới 1m, gói buffet có đồ nướng và lẩu dưới booking tên Tuấn. Khi đến nơi tôi cảm thấy không thật sự thoải mái khi được bố trí bàn nhỏ dưới lầu 1. Hỏi thêm thì được báo nhà hàng không phục vụ lầu 2. Chúng tôi cảm thấy không an toàn khi bàn ăn không xếp giãn cách theo yêu cầu phòng dịch cũng như bàn quá nhỏ và bức bí không đủ chỗ ngồi. Phải kê thêm 02 ghế rời ở lối đi.
Thức ăn thì gọi đem lên hạn chế do bản nhỏ không đủ chỗ đặt thức ăn vì thế chúng tôi có thỉnh cầu nhân viên về mảng thịt nướng giúp chúng tôi nướng sẵn từ trong cho đỡ tốn kém nhân lực phục vụ đồng thời tiết kiệm diện tích bàn. Quản lý báo là không  thể phục vụ dịch vụ nướng sẵn nữa. Chúng tôi ngạc nhiên vì lúc trước nhà hàng còn offer chúng tôi giúp nướng sẵn mà hiện tại lại không.
Chúng tôi cũng phải chấp nhận tuy nhiên sau đó thì than nướng không thật sự hiệu quả vừa yếu vừa lâu chín thịt.  Chất lượng thật sự đi xuống về cả mặt chất lượng đồ ăn, chất lượng dịch vụ . Bill thanh toán là 5tr280k, 600k cho 1 người thật sự là chưa xứng đáng.  Chúng tôi hiểu được do dịch bệnh nên nhà hàng tiết kiệm nhân lực để cầm cự . Chúng tôi đồng cảm với khó khăn đó. Góp ý trên đây mong cho nhà hàng tốt hơn chứ không mang tính phê phán dìm hàng. Xin cám ơn dịch vụ của nhà hàng !",

Price is a bit pricey but matches sense because of its location, decoration and service,… This restaurant is much more suitable for special parties (birthday or New Year…) or family meeting than couple.

Bánh căn is very good. Nice staffs",
140.2,4,"A well decorated restaurant with multi floor dining area. Serving typical Vietnamese cuisine and taste fine, nothing extraordinary.",
140.3,4,"Had a dinner with my big family, more than 12 people, including kid. In my opinion, this would be a fusion between middle and southern cuisine, not 100% middle cuisine taste. We ordered 6 dishes and ended up going round 2 for some of them. Great experience overall.",
140.4,3,"Easy to find the Khoai Restaurant at 16 Le Qui Don Street,  District 3. My friends and I  sometimes had dinner and lunch here.  Variety of foods you could choose, drink and food was ok anyway.👍 😋.  The restaurant looks clean with nice surroundings,  helpful staff. 🙎‍♀️💁‍♂️🍵🍹",
140.5,5,Enjoyed dining here. The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious. Was nervous about trying tue jellyfish salad but it was realy enjoyable. And the tuna was devine.,
140.6,5,"The restaurant looks cozy in general. The 1st floor has tables for small groups and the 2nd floor is for bigger groups so it's really loud. The waitor of our table is friendly and helpful. It was busy at that time so they do forget to serve some of what we order extra. The food tastes good, especially the fried rice with anchovies (very delicious). They sell some of the ingredients that they use in their menu, you can see at the entrance to buy. I forgot to take a pic of the hot pot at the end. The prices are quite high but once in a while to have a meal here is not a big deal. It's a must-try restaurant :)",
140.7,3,"Their name have a phrase about being specialized in good food of Nha Trang. This place may provide different flavor for tourist but not for me.
I have been to Nha Trang so many times and eat at so many places and other provinces in the central part of Vietnam but the flavor there somehow is different and more tasty.
The weak point here is the sauces, so salty. In Vietnam Cuisine, your sauces fail so your dishes is not good overall .
The price are expensive compared with the quantity and the quality of foods. There are some dishes that are so normal and I forget to take picture of them.
The atmosphere is not something special here. It looks clean and that’s all. The staff is ok.
I myself do not think this place can be a good place to give you good food of Nha Trang. There are a lot of good places for you to eat with more original flavor and super delicious sauces.",
140.8,5,Great place for seafood especially if you are dining in a group. We saw many locals eating at this place and there wasn't a single tourist in sight. Prices are reasonable and the service staff can speak English. I recommend getting the rice paper flower and jellyfish salad.,
140.9,4,"Not only tourists but also many locals choose this place to enjoy Vietnamese Nha Trang style cuisines. All dishes are good quality and very tasty (I guess the owner tried the best ways to keep the quality of seafood)
Price are reasonable. The service staffs are nice and well-trained to satisfy the customers.
My recommendation are Tuna noodle soup, Fried Rice with Green Chili and Grill Leather Jacket Fish with Chili Salt.",
140.10,2,"I came here as it was recommended by our hotel, but I had a really disappointing experience here.

I am a pescatarian and ordered the Banh Xeo with prawn and squid and specifically asked the waitress if it had any meat other than prawns. I was informed it hadn’t.

Upon it arriving at the table I noticed that there was some pork in when I had eaten one of the pancakes already (there was no squid). When I told the waitress she shrugged and didn’t really say much else. Considering a lot of people (including close friends and family) don’t eat pork for religious reasons, it was completely unacceptable to not be informed of the fact it had meat in.

When I told the staff I wasn’t happy about this before leaving, they didn’t take responsibility for this.

Pre-warning this incase other people find themselves in the same situation.",
140.11,4,Good dishes from the Nha Trang region. Upper middle level restaurant. Same with food price.  16 Le Qui Don is their new location.  Still same tasty food!,

And the setting is pretty nice (upstairs), although the restaurant is old and could be cleaner especially the way walking upstairs.

Dishes that i highly recommend: beef salad, escargot with pepper sauce (ốc bươu sốt tiêu), the crunchy mini crepes (bánh xèo), the Ninh Hoa rolls, and the chicken soup w lá é.",

140.25,1,"Great decoration, great food, awful service.

We were still eating at 21:30 but the staff already turned the lights off to close the restaurant. Asking for the paycheck, for the THIRD time, after more than 20 minutes that comes a waiter telling us that there were some ""server issues"" that had been keeping them from calculating the bill (?). Seriously? You think we know nothing so that you can say whatever you want?!

Such a pity that we really liked the decoration as well as the food, but the terrible service makes me think about returning no more.",
140.26,5,"The family and I were heading into the museum for the afternoon and we needed to find something close that caters for vegetarians and children and we stumbled upon this restaurant.

I'd recommend this restaurant to other vegetarians too.",
140.27,3,The food is fine but the service is good,
140.28,4,Lovely decor. Good food. A little bit too pricy and spicy for some dishes.,
140.29,2,"Totally disappointed! It has raised significantly all dishes' price while downgraded quality. All seafoods were no longer fresh, not to say it has been defrosted many times that i could not feel any flavors or texture of a squid or shrimp. Besides, such stingy management: I could not feel half full after 25$ bill paid. I had to eat another noodle bowl at a street vendor (but better taste, at only 1.2$). Dont ever get fooled by a crowd inside this restaurant. It's not worth your stomach",
140.30,4,The food is great. I love the spices!,
140.31,4,Fresh seafood and the service is good.  Prices are not cheap :),
140.32,1,"This restaurant does not deserve any star but I have to give at least one to write something.  The grilled fish was ordinary and did not have any taste at all.  The grilled shrimp was the most expensive among all other shrimp dishes.  The shrimps were boiled before they were grilled and the meat was a bit soft and I guessed they were not fresh.  The squids also had no taste at all.  I would not mind at all but they totalled at 860,000 VND which was very expensive and not commensurate with the taste, how they were cooked and the quality of the food.  The most disappointing seafood dinner in HCMC.",
140.33,3,Beer hoi with a Thai theme. Service is good but if your not ordering beer with a big group it will be expensive. Good covid following,
140.34,1,"ok but there's an announcement on the Tree that motorbike parking is free, car is 20k VND, but it's took 40k VND, certainly feel uncomfortable about this, never go back or recommend, it's just small problem but it's show disrespect to customers",

140.136,4,"Gia đình tổ chức tiệc thôi nôi bé trong nhà, không gian ấm cúng, set up đẹp, không gian thì khiêm tốn chút vì đất Quận 3 nên cũng ổn.
_Về món ăn, hình thức tới mùi vị 8/10
1.Món gỏi sứa ngon (ý kiến cá nhân là nên chút đậu phộng - lạc)
2.Chả ốc ăn được, không nổi bật gì
3.Tôm ủ muối hột tươi ngon, vừa ăn
4.Gà hấp mắm nhĩ vị lạ, vừa ăn
5.Cơm chiên cá Mờm khá ngon, vừa ăn, cơm tơi nhưng không hề bị khô quá hay ướt quá, chuẩn cơm chiên.
6.Lẩu bắp bò nhúng riêu thì bò tươi, riêu khá ngon, điểm trừ là bánh đa(bánh phở) ít và nước lẩu quá ít, không đủ nhúng bò và ăn.
7.Pudding lá dứa rất ngon, vị lá dứa nguyên chất mix cùng Lê và Dưa Hấu cắt hạt lựu cho vị tươi mát. Góp ý nhẹ là Pudding nên giảm chút Gelatin cho độ mềm hơn nữa, vì hiện đặc đang gần giống khúc bạch rồi.
_Về cách phục vụ thì cần đào tạo lại chút, dọn quá nhanh đôi lúc chưa hỏi qua ý khách đã dọn; dọn đĩa lót, muỗng (thìa) của khách luôn mà không đổi cho bộ mới thì lấy gì khách dùng🤣🤣🤣 ""Có lẽ mình hơi khó tính"" =>Nhìn chung tại mặt bằng Quận 3 đắt đỏ thì giá tiệc ở đây cũng hợp lí (mà giá nước tính riêng cao quá 😅), với những ai có nhu cầu tiệc gia đình tương đối chất lượng thì có thể tham khảo",
140.137,3,"Địa điểm dễ tìm. Nhân viên lễ phép, ngoại trừ NV giữ xe: ko dắt xe cho khách, ngồi chơi game, phì phèo thuốc lá, bước vào nhà hàng mà cảm giác còn tệ hơn quán ăn bình thường.
Món cá tắc kè nướng ngon, thịt dai.
Ốc xào tiêu đen khá đậm vị và cay nồng vị tiêu
Món cuối là Mực nhúng ớt xanh: nước lẩu ngon, nhưng mực ko tươi, ăn bị bở: giá thành của nhà hàng nhưng chất lượng vậy coi như bỏ.",

The taste is also very delicious,
The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious! !",
142.79,2,Phục vụ quá tệ . Như quán bia ôm . Chỉ toàn phục vụ bàn có đàn ông nhiều. Mặt thì chằm dằm . Order hay kêu gắp đá rất khó khăn,
142.80,5,"Đôi điều nhận xét: đây chỉ là ý kiến cá nhân nhé.

Đồ ăn ở đây ăn hợ khẩu vị 9/10 điểm

Không gian rộng thoáng mát 7/10

Phục vụ 5/10 . Quán không đông nhưng mình vẫn phải đợi để gọi món. Và một điều mình góp ý thêm là phục vụ ở đây hay giao tiếp bằng tiếng "" chụt chụt "" kiểu dùng miệng kêu chụt chụt để ra hiệu cho nhau ( giống mấy chị lady boy ở cầu vượt Hoàng Hoa Thám) gây phản cảm lắm

Giá cả không đắt nhưng cũng không rẽ. Giá phù hợp với vị trí mặt bằng và thiết kế.

Đây là ý kiến cá nhân của mình. Mong quán hoàng thiện hơn để đúng nghĩa 5 sao nhé.

Cảm ơn quán đã phục vụ bữa ăn ạ",

143.1,4,"Came here for lunch for a party of 4 on a Monday so there's plenty of seats available which is perfect as I love a quiet lunch time!

Our orders were:
1. Cơm ngó sen
2. Đậu hũ nấm gói giấy bạc. (Note: they use egg tofu)
3. Rau lang xào tỏi
4. Canh nấm mói kiểu Thái
Some bottles of water

#1 & 2 are pretty darn good 👍, not overly season light on salt, #3 is good too simple enough as if I can cook it myself lol. #4 a bit disappointed in terms of both quality and quantity, nấm mói aka termite mushrooms aren't what my friend would describe and the taste of the soup didn't win our votes either

My friend says the quality of the food has gone down over the years, it was fantastic wheb they were first open some 5 years ago. Despite that, the food was pretty much on point

Our bill came out was a hair under 400k, which is really good considering the cool place that looks like a real restaurant in China without 3 hours of flight, 4 hours of traffic and 1 hours 30 minutes of wait time 😂.

Vibe: quite lunchtime, bonus: some tiny cockroaches running around. 4
Food: Light on seasoning. 4.5
Price: Good selections, they have set menu too. 4.5
Service: Customer friendly. 5
Overall: 4.5 . Will repeat",

143.5,5,Great food! Especially the crispy rice cakes with soy floss! Nice ambience but it is a bit far from district one. The hakka steamed yam was a unique and tasty dish :),

143.10,3,"Update…. After two years out of VN, we came back.  The food is quite nice still, but the wait time after ordering is very, very, very unacceptably long. Service no longer caring, attentive and friendly as was several years ago.
From 2 years ago: Beautiful food seems inspired by Chinese cuisine, so unusual, as we have mostly experienced Vietnamese style chay.  Everything was delicious!  Impossible to choose the most favorite dish as all earned most favorite!  Staff very nice, attentive and prompt.  Lots of tables for many customers, but the light, decor and furnishings keeps the feeling homey and private.",
143.11,3,Very nicely set up and decorated room. Lots of tables and seats for customers. Food is delicious but also a bit salty and oily for a Western taste. They have an extensive menu with the dish names in English and pictures of them. However the English text is hard to read because the restaurant environment is quite dark. When I visited the raiders were not very careful. One of them was quite clumsy and brought us portions that we did not order. however the stuff tried to be very friendly and helpful and there was no problem correcting the mistakes.,
143.12,5,"The food, atmosphere, and service was excellent. Service was a little on the slow side, but everything tasted so fresh. Their menu is clearly labeled in Vietnamese (if it contains eggs, garlic/onion and two other labels that I'm still not quite sure of since I am not fluent in Vietnamese). It is easy to miss if you are not looking for their sign (small and round). They are located right below a tearoom.",
143.13,4,It is a vegan restaurant. The food is great and it offers variety of Vietnamese dishes in the same category. The decoration is authentic and has a country side vibe.

Các món gỏi cũng cực kỳ ngon. Mình đánh giá cao quán bởi thức ăn ngon, giá tiền vừa phải, phần ăn nhiều mà không gian cũng ấm cúng. Đi 3 người mà gọi 4 món là no xỉu ăn không nổi luôn. Vì quán nằm trên đường một chiều dưới chân cầu Nguyễn Tri Phương nên bạn Google để không mất công vòng lại nha. Nhân viên rất thân thiện, chu đáo.",
143.66,4,"Thức ăn cũng tạm ổn ko có gì đặc sắc, gỏi hơi ngọt. Quán nằm góc khuất, lúc mình đi lên lầu 1 còn khá bề bộn chưa sửa sang hơi giống nhà kho. Hy vọng quán cải thiện không gian lầu 1.",

143.70,5,"Tới quán hơi lòng vòng 1 xíu nhưng điểm cộng là không gian quán đẹp kiểu yên tĩnh  quán cũng không quá đông mình rất thích
Đồ ăn vì menu quá nhiều món nên cũng có món ngon món bình thường.
Mình không thích các món gỏi lắm vì sốt trộn giống nhau & khá giống lẩu thái.
Tuy nhiên món lẩu nấm, cơm ép chiên giòn, cơm trái thơm hoặc miến tay cầm thì khá ngon.
Nha đam đường phèn mình thấy không quá ngọt, thanh.
Tổng kết mình thấy quán vẫn xứng đáng 5 sao. Dẫn bạn bè mình đi cũng khá ưng",

143.74,1,"Chổ này không gian cũng đc. Bạn Phục vụ cũng nhiệt tình dể thương.
Nhưng bếp làm chậm quá. Mình vào order ngồi đợi 45p chưa lên đủ món.
Ghét nhất là đã ko làm thức ăn kịp cho khách thì đừng nhận khách.
Nhận rồi thì cứ 15-20p lên món thì ăn chừng 1-2 món là no ngang.
Vì lý do đó nên mình đã kêu tính tiền và bỏ mấy món sau ko ăn nữa.

Thức ăn thì mặn. Có thể do mình k quen ăn chay lên ăn vào có vẻ ko vừa miệng. Tuỳ khẩu vị của mỗi người.

Đồ ăn cũng k rẻ. Rau 80-90k/ dĩa 😬 mắc hơn ăn mặn.",

Duyên số đưa mình tới Bếp chay An Duyên.
Bếp nằm ở bên hông chân cầu Nguyễn Tri Phương, từ Võ Văn Kiệt quẹo phải xíu là tới.
Tất cả dịch vụ đều chuẩn, từ khâu tiếp đón.
Về món ăn mình gọi 3 món, chuẩn vị từng món, rất ngon mọi người ạ. Thêm ly nước mát hạt chia.
Hai ng gia đình mình ăn khoảng 278k. Một giá khá mềm cho hai chữ Nhà Hàng.
Nơi đây cũng phù hợp cho cặp đôi trẻ muốn đổi vị

Nhưng mình sẽ quay lại nếu muốn ăn đồ chay❤️❤️❤️❤️",
143.77,5,"Món ăn ở đây rất rất ngon. Đây cũng là một quán mình ghé lại rất nhiều lần vì đồ ăn ngon, giá phù hợp với 1 phần ăn lớn cỡ 70-80k, không gian cũng ổn nữa. Mình thấy ngon nhất là canh chua thái nấm mối, cà tím tay cầm, củ sen cung bảo, lẩu thái, pad thái, hủ tiếu áp chảo. Còn nấm nướng giấy bạc chưa ngon đồng bộ",
143.78,5,"Đồ ăn An Duyên thì ngon khỏi bàn rồi, ăn ngày thường mới có bàn chứ ngày chay là khó đặt bàn được. Mình đặc biệt thích cà ri xanh vì các quán khác thường không có, dù vị hơi ngọt, gia giảm chút sẽ ổn hơn. Giá cả kêu theo set lẩu thì rất hợp lý. Lần này mình đi nhà hàng đang có thi công nên hơi lộn xộn chứ không gian không được thư giãn như mọi lần.",

- Điểm trừ: Mình đã đi 3 lần trên 1 con đường mới đến dc đây vì nhà hàng nằm dưới chân cầu, số địa chỉ nhảy lung tung… Nhà hàng làm bảng hiệu khá tối nên khó nhận ra, hôm nay mình đến ăn tối ngồi vào vị trí khá nóng, có lẽ máy lạnh đã củ và ko đủ công suất cho không gian to

143.91,4,"Ngon xuất sắc nên đến ăn thử một lần. Món cà ri xanh cực kỳ ngon nhaaa, không ăn uổng phí. Các món còn lại đều ngon và vừa miệng dù đối với mình cà ri xanh là chân ái. Các món gỏi cũng cực kỳ ngon. Mình đánh giá cao quán bởi thức ăn ngon, giá tiền vừa phải, phần ăn nhiều mà không gian cũng ấm cúng. Đi 3 người mà gọi 4 món là no xỉu ăn không nổi luôn. Vì quán nằm trên đường một chiều dưới chân cầu Nguyễn Tri Phương nên bạn Google để không mất công vòng lại nha. Nhân viên rất thân thiện, chu đáo.",
143.92,5,Quán chay ăn rất ngon nhưng hơi tối xíu mà vẫn ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,
143.93,5,"Món chay ở An Duyên chế biến ngon, thực đơn đa dạng, nhân viên cũng nhẹ nhàng chu đáo. Những ngày rằm và mùng 1 thường rất đông, nên đặt bàn trước. Mình gọi hủ tíu Hồng  Kong, cơm trái thơm, rau rừng kho quẹt, đậu hũ nấm phô mai, củ sen cung bảo, vịt quay sốt tiêu xanh, nước táo quế và trà sen vải, tổng chưa tới 500k. Món củ sen làm theo kiểu Tứ Xuyên mình thấy ngon nhất trong số những món mình gọi. Đầu tiên còn hơi tiếc vì bàn bên ăn lẩu chao chay thơm nức nở nhưng do món lẻ nào cũng ngon nên cũng mãn nguyện hihi.",
143.94,5,"Almost no Japanese people end up here, but I think this is a good place to eat Vietnamese Shojin cuisine when staying in Vietnam. However, it is only available in Vietnamese, so you need to look at the pictures and order. Vegetables, mushrooms, and rice are so filling and delicious. It's a completely different world from Japanese shojin ryori. Japan may be behind in this area",
143.95,4,"Mình kêu set 325k + 2 khăn ướt là 329k, gồm những món ăn bên dưới. Nói chung tất cả đều vừa miệng và ngon. Mình thích nhất món canh vì ăn vào nước rất là thanh. Món củ sen xào hơi nhiều, 2 người mà ăn không hết 😭. Nước trà ngon và thơm 🥰
Chú ý : quán ở dưới cầu, đừng chạy lên trên cầu là phải đi vòng lại xa đó nha.",
143.96,5,"Các món đồng đều, chỉ có món cơm chiên trái thơm cả nhóm chúng tôi nhận xét là dở 😗 cơm mềm nhão do bị làm ướt từ thơm, cơ bản không phải là món cơm chiên.
Không gian hơi tối với ai mắt hơi kém.
Quán ngay dưới chân cầu, người lạ khó kiếm được chỗ.",
143.97,4,"Món ngon: đậu hủ giấy bạc, pad thái, lẩu mua nước nổi, lẩu khoai môn, cơm chiên hạt sen, duy món cơm cháy thì nhiều dầu, quán nên thấm bớt dầu, vị thì ok",
143.98,5,"Hôm nay ngày cuối tháng âm lịch nên mọi người trong công ty mình rủ nhau đi ăn đồ chay ở An Duyên.

Thiết kế của nhà hàng rất đẹp, ấm cúng, mang đậm chất Trung Hoa. Menu đa dạng, nhiều món lạ nên khách có thể chọn theo ý muốn.

Bàn mình order món thì cỡ khoảng 5 phút nhân viên đã bắt đầu đem món lên khá nhanh. Nhân viên phục vụ niềm nở, nhiệt tình với khách, nói chuyện rất lịch sự nữa.

Giá cả hợp lý, phù hợp cho những buổi sum họp với gia đình và hội họp cùng đồng nghiệp, bạn bè.

Nói chung lần đầu mình ăn đồ chay ở nhà hàng An Duyên như vậy là khá ổn. Mình rất thích cách bày trí và sự phục vụ của nhân viên nên sẽ quay lại nếu có dịp. 👍👍👍",
143.99,4,Không gian thoáng nhưng hơi tối. Món ăn hợp khẩu vị nhất là đối với những người ăn chế độ giảm cân. Ngon nhưng giá hơi cao,
143.100,4,"Đồ ăn:
Nêm nếm vừa miệng. Menu tập trung vào những món của riêng quán.
Quán tuy mắc, giá trung bình 70k/món, nhưng chất lượng và số lượng đều đủ cả

Không gian:
Trang trí độc đáo, mang phong sắc Trung Hoa, ấm cúng.
Thích hợp hẹn hò, ăn gia đình.

Thái độ:
Nhân viên nhanh gọn, thân thiện",

143.104,5,"Hôm nay có dịp ghé lại quán, quán luôn tạo cho mình cảm giác hài lòng. Quán có không gian rộng rãi, yên tịnh, món ăn ở đây rất ngon, bày trí đẹp mắt, giá cả thì quá ư là hợp lí, mình có chụp sơ sơ về menu quán, mình cũng kêu khá nhiều món nhưng vì ham ăn quá nên đã ăn mà quên chụp mấy món kia hihihi. Nhà mình đi 14 người đặt bàn qua table now được giảm giá 10% nữa. Ăn quá chời k hết phải bỏ hộp đem về mà bill chỉ có 875k thôi, quá hợp lí cho một buổi tối họp mặt trò chuyện cùng gia đình!!!",
143.105,5,"Ở đây có hai khu vực phía dưới là nhà hàng chay bếp xanh ăn Duyên phía trên lầu là quán cà phê.
Mọi người có thể lên lầu vừa uống nước rồi ăn các món của nhà hàng.
Nhìn chung giá ở đây cao hơn một tẹo so với mặt bằng nhưng khá là ngon. Mình cảm thấy hài lòng.
Các món liên quan đến đậu hũ và đặc biệt là món xào cung Bảo rất là ngon",

143.107,4,"Không gian rất gần gũi, thức ăn ngon,sạch sẽ, giá cả chấp nhận được (Không đắt), nhân viên nhanh nhẹn.
Điểm trừ: không có chỗ đậu ôtô nên khó đưa  khách đoàn tới đây.",
143.108,4,"Nhân viên lịch sự, quán ăn ngon, không gian thoải mái mà giá cũng ok ko quá mắc",

144.1,5,"This place comes highly recommended, from the cuisine to the service, it was the nicest experience we had in Vietnam
I truly enjoy Vietnamese cuisine with my friends, and this restaurant excels at providing it. The food is flavorful and delicious (rating 9,5/10), and you should try the veal, chicke thigh, flower salad with tiger prawns,...

Finally, thank you Home Saigon and staff for making our finest day possible.",
144.2,5,"One of a kind!
Truly warm greetings from the staff
and the food is very nice and full of taste.
You also can enjoy old but fascinating house.",
144.3,5,"A very good restaurant.
Highly recommend.
the food was very delicate, flavor is very nice.
it might be pricy, but worth it.",
144.4,5,"The food was really delicious and the service was great. I had the Avocado Fresh Rolls With Chicken and the Vegetarian Deep Fried Spring Rolls to start. I’d highly recommend the Fried Spring Rolls. Easily one of the best spring rolls I’ve had. For my main I had the Home Saigon Grilled Chicken With Coconut Rice which was also really delicious. The sauce is really tasty. It comes with rice and a small salad (see pic) I had the Jamaica Juice to drink, which was also really nice. It’s a combo of hibiscus and lychee. Highly recommend it. All in all this was a really pleasant experience. Our host, Kana was wonderful and friendly too.",
144.5,5,"Excellent food, excellent service, all the staff was so attentive and made sure I was having a wonderful meal and experience. 10/10 must go.",
144.6,5,"One of the best meals we’ve had in Saigon!

We’d definitely recommend anyone who loves to have authentic Vietnamese food to come to this spot.
Service by Khang was spot on, and the music was amazing!

Different menu to the branch in Hanoi so do expect something that caters to only Saigon.

Would recommend updating the google maps link, as we couldn’t seem to find it, we had to look for the old restaurant that was Chopstick Saigon",
144.7,5,"Had a great dinner and very attentive service from Khang.
We had the deep fried crab spring rolls,  steamed tiger prawns wrapped in lotus leaf and hot rock salt as well as their seasonal vegetables with garlic and char grilled pork rib with Saigon spices. Really delicious!",
144.8,5,"Nice find in a narrow alley in D3. Vietnamese good with a twist, but great flavors and service. Klaus was very attentive and everything was great. The ambience is quaint, so it’s a great place to go with someone and enjoy food and conversation.",
144.9,5,Customer service and decor was fantastic. Booked this place for our last family dinner on our trip to Vietnam and was surely not disappointed. Food was so delicious and would highly recommend. Even had live music which was very entertaining and pleasant.. 😊 …,
144.10,4,"I have a lunch here, the staff and service nice and prepared, mainly young. The setting is modern and new, big glass wall, good pond and black counter, everywhere plants. The food was all good and fresh, I ate fish, meat and vegetables and I didn’t find nothing strange. I drunk local Saigon beer and wine. Honest price for a polished. The kitchen is open view.",
144.11,3,"Foods here are generally authentic Thai food. Food is quite tasty and I like the fish soup the most. I did not had a good appetite as I had a good breakfast and lunch was too close. I guess I will enjoy the foods more if i had an empty stomach. Foods here is not too bad, maybe will return again.",
144.12,3,"Food is decent but overpriced when viewed from a food quality perspective. Service, decor, and atmosphere are all top notch, 5-star.

We ordered the fix price menu for two with the drink packages. Several courses were served including a huge lobster. Kind of disappointed that only the lobster tail meat was served. The lobster claws, knuckles, and leg meat were not included (juiciest and sweetest parts!)

Each course tasted a bit bland. But plated impeccably.

Overall, go here if you want top notch service and decor. Come here for a romantic date. Come here if you like to Instagram your food. But if you're exploring to satiate your taste buds, better options are available elsewhere.",
144.13,5,"From beginning to end, the food was excellent and service to match. Most of the dishes were authentic and brought out the right flavours and herbs. The ingredients were fresh and balanced. Would definitely return.",
144.14,5,"Brilliant food, would definitely recommend. Quite high end for HCM and a bit pricier than most but a class above - google maps location is wrong and is 216 on the street (down an alley) - was a pain for us to find but a gorgeous interior and phenomenal food",
144.15,5,"Great decor and setting and the service staff were outstanding. Food was a little bit hit and miss though. The beef in particular tasted strange, as if it had been thawed and frozen once too often. Still 5 stars though as overall it was very good. I would come back.",
144.16,5,"HOME Saigon, located at the end of alley 216, provided an excellent dining experience with outstanding food, top-notch service, and a captivating atmosphere. Highly recommended.",
144.17,5,"Must come back next trip in HCM, great food with good service! Every dishes are impressed, reasonable price. Had live band during the meal. Minh had great service for us, we had a really lovely dinner.",
144.18,5,Came here for V day dinner. V day set dinner is not available anymore as they ran out of lobsters. A bit of a shame. Proceed to order from A La Carte menu. Excellent. Tiger prawns are fresh. Mango Flambe dessert is a must. Services and atmosphere are great as well.,
144.19,5,"We were here because the good reviews on the internet. I am glad we were here because it's turely tasty. The waiter Henry ( Mr. Van) is very friendly and helpful. Henry speaks good English, so there's no communication problem. The food he suggested are delicious! We didn't order much tonight because we eat light at night. Since the dishes taste good, I keep looking at the menu and wishing we could eat more. We will definitely coming back in the future.",
144.20,5,"Amazing and attentive service. Food is of fine dining level. Highly recommend this avacado rolls. It balances the taste of fresh seafood with veggie. The atmosphere is relaxing. They play classic western songs, bringing you back to the good old romantic era.",
144.21,5,"nice and friendly staff, food really good, high recomend..",
144.22,5,"If you want a lovely place for good quality and authentic Vietnamese food then Home Finest is a right place for you. Outstanding decoration indoor and outdoor, great service, reasonable prices for super fresh ingredients. What is more to ask??
If you haven’t been in Home, well don’t miss a chance!",
144.23,5,"Amazing food, the mango flambé is lit on fire for you and food is great. $50 usd for the meal. The service wasn’t as good as I would want compared to like the garlik but regardless was a great meal.

Ambiance is on point",
144.24,4,Indeed fine dinning. We make reservations before heading down. Staffs were friendly. Environment is pretty. A must try for their Lobster prawn. Amazingly good. That the only dish we love n found is surprising tasty. Other dishes were average.,
144.25,3,"Very nice atmosphere for wine and small bites. Not the best restaurant for authentic Vietnamese taste. Was a little disappointed with the sea bass which came out too dry. The food here is pretty pricey, hence it’s not value for money IMO. Can get better tasting food elsewhere at a way cheaper price.",
144.26,4,"Atmosephere is good, service is great as well. We ordered fresh spring roll, pho noodle soup and chicken curry. Spring roll and noodle soup is nice, but I don’t think it is that delicious as other described.",
144.27,5,"The seasonal set menu is on the website but not in the restaurant. However, other food are good and the service is excellent. Will definitely recommend to friends and you.",
144.28,5,"Great Vietnamese food, and friendly service, in a stylish interior, split over 3 floors, with outdoor seating on the 1st floor balcony if weather permits.

We shared a variety of dishes, and struggled to fault any.",

144.30,4,"I must say the food is over rated for the price. You are really paying for the great plantation style ambiance and amazing service. Maybe just come and share an entree. Skip the fresh spring roll, but the pancake is tasty. Beer selection is poor and cocktails are a bit weak. Only two choices of wine by the glass but several bottles available,  for a $price.",
144.31,5,"Had a really enjoyable dinner with my family here, excellent service from Khang and Nguyen, amazing food as well.",
144.32,5,Good food. Excellent service. Special thanks to Khang.,
144.33,4,"Came here since it had good reviews on tripadvisor. The place has good atmosphere and very good service. Elly was our waitress for the evening and she was really nice and welcoming. Ordered some 5 foods in total and 2 cocktails. The signature drinks were very good, refreshing and unique in style and presentation. The food was delicious but the portions are rather small in size. While we enjoyed eating here I believe it was not worth the price (expect to spend some 800-1000k per person). Can recommend if you dont mind spending extra but for those on budget there are many places with better value.",
144.34,5,Foods here is AMAZING. Highly recommended. Service is perfect. Price is reasonable.,
144.35,5,"Amazing dining experience,super nice services
But the location is a bit difficult to find",
144.36,4,"Like the food at there. Abit expensive and fancy. They are attentive to customers when ordering. Regarding the payment time, they will take abit more time to attend to.
The waiters there can speak and listen english language.",
144.37,5,"The first time I came here. Vietnamese food in this restaurant is very delicious, combined with drinks such as cooktail, wine ... very good and great.",

There have course and a la crate too.
Good vibe and beautiful dishes.
Good taste.",
144.39,4,"The starter and the main dishes are nice, however the desserts are a bit disappointing, can skip the dessert. Anyway, worth to come.",
144.40,5,"Very nice decorated restaurant, not too far from the city center (you need a taxi, regardless of where you are staying).
We loved the design, the atmosphere, the service and the food/traditional cuisine.
Low-mid range prices for Westerners, probably expensive for Vietnamese standards (we just arrived so we did not get the idea of the cost of living yet.) Hidden gem.",
144.41,5,"Amazing food and service, though the bottled water was an absolute RIP off!!",
144.42,5,"As a catering professional, I recently visited and had dinner at the Home Finest Saigon restaurant. It was such an exceptionnal meal, full of original flavours and served by an excellent team. The concept really respects the Vietnamese cuisine and its products. I highly recommend this well-known address.",
144.43,5,"Great service, ambiance, and food! it's really good value for the kind of food quality!",
144.44,5,Beautiful place with great service and food. Prices are definitely in the higher end compared to other places but you pay for the ambience and the service.,
144.45,5,Great foods and warm service with cello performance for people who are looking for a fine restaurant in Ho Chi Minh.,
144.46,5,Top 10 French Vietnamese restaurants in the city. Love the atmosphere and food.,
144.47,5,Great food and fantastic service by emma! Thank you so much!,
144.48,5,Very decent Vietnamese food.  Good ambience here!,
144.49,3,"Not very fredh seafood, squid like rubber, room for my group not very comfortable: 16 guests on low couch and small space to eat. Atmosphere in the group room 2nd floor not very nice",
144.50,5,Very nice and fine. Should try the mango flambé and glass noodle with crab,
144.51,5,"Everything is great.
Service with a smile indeed
I have come twice in month.

144.54,5,Great food and awesome service highly recommended,
144.55,3,"We had a party of about 10 or so. We all were very excited to try this place with all the good reviews. Unfortunately, it did NOT live up to the hype.

Food was just ok. We had several different meat dishes and a few vegetable dishes. All decent, but nothing that wowed us. There was one dish that almost nobody ate after one bite (gluten something or other). For the price, the food let us down.

The service was very good though! Our wait staff was kind, prompt and very accommodating to a large group.

Must say that the decor is beautiful. Luxurious, comfy chairs. A relaxing fountain that takes up an entire wall leading out to a peaceful patio in front.

Bottom line: service and decor is excellent. But food quality and value for the money? Not so great.",
144.56,5,"We decided to go there because we really wanted a more sophisticated environment. Definitely worth to visit. The place is beautiful. The staff is kind: the food is good. I will not say great because I still think that the Vietnamese cuisine has a lack of flavour. But definitely was the best meal I had on my trip.
I just think the wines were too expensive compared to the food. We choose to have beer instead due to the discrepancy in prices. Our waitress was so kind she even got a discounted for us to go in their branch in Hanoi.
Their Pho was the best I ate in Vietnam and a very good portion to be considered a starter.",
144.57,5,"My family and I had a great experience at Home Finest. The restaurant is very eye-catching and luxurious, the staff is extremely friendly and I feel very welcome when entering the restaurant by the hostess. We ordered the special set menu for Tet holiday, the grilled beef in flaming coconut and Caramelized tiger prawn with chilli and garlic are my favorite. My family and I are very satisfied with the service here and we definitely will return.",
144.58,5,"Delicious food, perfect service. Highly recommended.",
144.59,5,"Amazing Food, Staff and atmosphere 10/10",
144.60,4,"Great atmosphere and great service. Maybe a bit pricy and I don't understand why they serve German water here. Food was excellent, I would would consider it being a mix between European and Vietnamese cuisine. Reservation is recommended as well as dressing up as it is a bit upscale. Approximately 20-30€ for a three course dinner.",
144.61,5,"Restaurant atmosphere is good
Good waiter attitude
The meal is very delicious👍 …",
144.62,3,"UPDATE: HOME finest has dealt with our experience extremely professionally. It is easily one of best displays of customer service we have ever encountered. Thank you to Riley and her team for going over what was necessary to meet our concerns.

Great service and ambience but other than that everything about the dining experience at HOME was a complete dissapointment. For the price point, the quality of food is completely abyssmal. Truthfully, it tasted like an amateur's first attempt at a dish. The table next to us was also visibly and audibly shocked at the standard of the courses.

On top of that, my girlfriend suffered from violent food poisoning immediately after our meal. She ended up vomiting up everything we ate.

I have no idea where such positive reviews come from but it's definitely unjustified.

I highly DO NOT recommend dining at HOME finest. If i could 0 stars, I would. I've never posted reviews before, but this restaurant was so bad I felt it was my duty to let everyone know.",
144.63,5,"Excellent food. Cozy atmosphere. Excellent staff and service. Food is superb, especially sea bass . Cocktails are on the sweet side, it should be expected but very well made. If you are looking for fancy outing it would be a perfect place.",

144.66,5,"First time visiting Vietnam,celebrating our wedding anniversary in this restaurant,the service was very good and Thomas’s so friendly. The food so good and the environment! For the food pricing not so expensive. Will recommend to my friends about this restaurant.  Great atmosphere and food. Thomas was very helpful the whole evening. The price is very reasonable too!!",
144.67,5,"I loved this restaurant. They provided exceptional customer service and delicious Vietnamese food. The waiters were very kind, our waiter showed us the proper method of eating our dishes i.e. for the banh xeo the waiter showed us how to eat it with the veggies and herbs and she even made it for us. They were very attentive and made sure that we were enjoying our meal. We even had a great time talking with the manager (or owner) and he gave us a complimentary mango flambe which was fun to watch and delicious to eat. The restaurant is also very beautiful.",
144.68,2,"Dined here recently, beware of TripAdvisor reviews they are asked for by the hotel staff and even ask you to speak positively of your server by name.  Asked us to fill out a comment card and were noticeably upset when we did not give them all 5 stars.  The ambiance in this expensive restaurant by Vietnam standards is immediately a downer with the curse of SE Asia, the bright Led lighting! My wife had the king prawns and was disappointed, my duck was decent but not exceptional. Overall average for an expensive bill at the end of the night.",
144.69,5,"Delicous food, warm welcoming, europe design.",
144.70,4,"This new, international-level restaurant near the city center is a great place to have some drinks (cocktails are really good). The atmosphere is nice, and the service is just impeccable. But the food does not match the other qualities of the venue. Some dishes are westernized to strange result (like fried rice with vegetables, which turned to be something once can expect in a cheap European cafe). Pomelo salad was nicely served and tasty, though. Also, note, that the venue is usually full, so reservation would be a wise idea. Ah, yeh - the WC does not meet the restaurant level at all.",
144.71,3,"Service was good, nice atmosphere, meals are okay but it was nothing special. For that it was waaaaayyy too expensive in our opinion! We were also shocked about the prices of a bottle of water?! We won‘t come again, you get same meals and quality for less money somewhere else.",
144.72,3,The staff is trying hard to get as good review as possible but should be more than that for five stars. The outdoor terrace siting could be more comfortable and the food in Vietnam is normaly of better taste. We were pushed to try a  fish which was far from tasty. Too expensive for what they offer.,
144.73,5,Great ambience for fine dine in the city. The pink pamelo salad with king prawn is a must. Not to forget the fantastic service and recommendation provided by Riley. The price is marginal high but well compliment with the dishes and services provided.,
144.74,5,"Very nice decoration and atmosphere. It makes me feel like home but this house is like dream house cause everything looks fancy. Although the price is expensive, it is worth the money. It is an ideal place for lunch/dinner with special guests.

HCM 03/08/2018",
144.75,4,"Mixed feelings with great service and atmosphere, but of our three dishes the chicken curry was ordinary, the mushroom and tofu soup should be called vegetable soup with mushroom. The stir fried beef was great.  But they couldn't give a cup of got water.  Also a few mosquitos inside.",
144.76,5,Good to end the day on a high note after some touring in the city. Very delicious and creative dishes! Topped off by professional and thoughtful services from Do and Anna especially! Would recommend this place to any fellow travelers.,
144.77,5,"Excellent food and really nice and chic ambience.
You should absolutely try the beef on hot stone and the tiger prawns, and also the mango flambee.
Very nice staff and we didn't have to wait for our food too long so good point.",
144.78,4,Food was pretty good. We had the fixed price menu. Wish I ordered ala carte. Nice staff. Not thrilled about being asked to fill out critique right after meal. Need a reservation.,
144.79,1,"Terrible experience. Menu don’t sign the minimum charge, but when we just order four dishes, their server push us to order more. Let me feel bad. And their “fried rice in lotus” is super tasteless, using frozen vegetables,very dry and no fragrance.

Wellcome to TAIWAN to taste what is real fried rice.",
144.80,5,Excellent food and service. The fried spring rolls were delicious! I definitely recommend this restaurant to people looking for upscale (but very affordable in USD) Vietnamese in Ho Chi Minh City.,
144.81,5,"This is the best food and restaurant I experienced so far in 10 days od travelling in Vietnam.
Naam the waiter was very nice and gave to us an EXCELLENT service providing info of dish histories and showing us the best way to enjoy the food.
Wine was a fairly good quality as well.

I would reccomend it to anyone with no doubts",

I'll come back again. Thanks!!!",
144.85,5,Very good quality restaurant,
144.86,5,The banh xeo is amazing!!! They made it vegetarian for us. I've never tasted anything quite like it. Worth the price. But it was the most expensive by far during our stay.,
144.87,2,"Very disappointed. Food dishes not tasteful. Duck was very chewy, wagyu beef not special. Too expensive. service is not friendly and not profesional. Manger is arrogant. Wine waiter poured wine all over the table. Toilets very dirty, no toilet paper.",

I will come again or not? 50-50",
144.93,4,Good service and good food. Service is good too. But not exception. Location is a bit remote from our hotel. I believe not cheap comparable to other local restaurants,
144.94,1,"Make reservations before you go, i went there around 12 pm and the seats were already full. The waitress was not able to arrange a seat for us, instead they suggested us to leave and go to other restaurants.",
144.95,5,Very helpful. Came twice but were fully booked. Manager Eddie helped us arrange for another sister restaurant and solicited and paid for a cab to the restaurant. Great service!!,
144.96,5,"Very nice, kind, clean ^^",
144.97,4,"As its name, all quality and taste seems very fine .  kindness & speacking english are quite accepatable. Good price is an additional advantage. Strongly recommand!",

Tuy nhiên có rất nhiều thứ tệ hại khiến tôi sẽ không bao giờ quay lại và ngăn chặn người quen có ý định tổ chức ở đây:
1/ Cách phục vụ rất tệ, nhà hàng thuê nhân viên thời vụ phục vụ cho tiệc của tôi, khi khách của tôi hỏi thông tin thì trả lời cộc lốc kiểu ""Tôi làm thời vụ nên không biết!""
2/ Sau khi tôi đã tip cho phục vụ thì lại tiếp tục đòi tiền tip (vì một người em của tôi thanh toán hóa đơn).
3/ Không có sẵn sàng âm thanh tại quán để phục vụ hát, nhà hàng gợi ý thuê dịch vụ thì dàn nhạc rất dở, chúng tôi phải tự mở nhạc bằng điện thoại để hát.

And I have to speak up that the vegetables are really much fresher, maybe they grow It better locally, for e.g., the corianders, chillis, shallots & etc really stands out.

First to confirm, this restaurant get good chef, main dishes are about 8-8.5/10. So these are reasons why I give such 3 stars:
1. Price is very high because comparing to its service. The waiter and waitress, as well as their manager, they were not smiling nor friendly, not at all. I worked in a 5 star service years ago, this is very not professional.
2. Secondly, about the soup, they made them like a joke for an expensive Chinese cuisine. I ordered 2 soups, both is very thick with corn starch. I worked in kitchen before, I am quite sure that both of the soup is the same, just differed from extra ingredients.
Thanks and best regard my friends",

Ask how much the phoenix screw 1 kg 600,000 VND

151.1,5,"A pleasant dining experience both for the palate and the eyes. Prices are in keeping with the restaurant style, food presentation and quality. Perfect for a higher-end dining experience or to entertain visitors, without spending an exhorbitant amount. (Note: my cost estimate was per person; three people shared 5 dishes.)

They specialize in Vietnamese crepes with a variety of savory fillings - and a mushroom vegetarian option - (eaten with a generous amount of fresh greens and herbs); ingredients for fresh spring rolls with a tantalizing array of possibilities (platters of fresh greens, herbs, vegetables, rice vermicelli, rice paper and your choice of meat fill your table); meat or fish soups; and salads. Fried rice, stirfried greens, and some seafood dishes are also available. Fresh juice in a variety of combinations is also a feature.

The presentation is eye-catching and the flavors are well-balanced.

The greens and herbs were very clean and fresh (see photo of greens/herbs storage).

The restaurant has been renovated and redecorated, with seating upstairs, so there’s significantly more space than what you see when you first walk in.

The staff are prompt, friendly, attentive and patient.

A shout out to the security who watch your bikes: efficient, careful, attentive. They noticed I had dropped something (I didn’t realize it) and not only picked it up for me, but also took the initiative to request a small bag to replace my paper bag, which hadn’t survived the rain.

The salad serving size was smaller than it looked in the photo, but as an appetizer, it was appropriate.",

This is a restaurant loved by locals, so foreigners
almost hard to find

From Ben Thanh Market, take Tran Hung Dao Road.
Looking at the tourist street to the right, pass by
Go straight for about 5 minutes and it is in the alley on the left.

Prices are affordable and Vietnamese food is diverse.
Banh xeo, banh kot, buntitneung, various types of fried rice,
There are a lot of beef shabu-shabu, meat, spring rolls, etc.

Personally, I love the ability to divide (Bún thịt nướng)
Likes.

However, there are always a lot of customers, so if you go and order
The food doesn't come out quickly, so if there are several people

Về phần order món ăn, bàn mình đã order rất là nhiều phần mỗi món 3 phần, thì lúc thêm 1 phần   Bánh xèo nv có thể cho thêm 1 ít kiến nghị cho khách bánh xèo hơi to hỏi khách có mún thêm ko?
Hi vọng quán sẽ cải thiện lại cách service",

Nhà hàng tương đối ổn, nhân viên bận đồng phục lịch sự, quán mình ghé vài lần đều đông nên đặt bàn trước cho chắc. Món ăn theo mình thì chưa phong phú lắm, trình bày món đẹp mắt, sạch sẽ.giá cả nếu ở mặt bằng quận 1 thì có thể nói là hợp lý. Khách nơi này theo mình quan sát là gia đình, nhóm bạn làm ăn, dân văn phòng là nhiều. Thiên về ăn uống nhiều hơn là ăn nhậu. Đánh giá chung là tương đối ổn!",

2. Không gian:
- Cũng xịn xò, nhưng nhìn tổng thể thì chưa được như mong muốn lắm. Như phòng của mình, có 1 vài góc cũng còn lộn xộn. Kiểu ở đây chỉ tập trung đầu tư cho mỗi phòng và nội thất trong phòng thôi, bày trí và không gian bên ngoài không ăn khớp gì cả, nhìn hơi bừa bộn và dơ dơ.
- Có máy chiếu, karaoke (âm thanh không hay đâu, do đâu phải quán karaoke :)))
- Có 1 chuyện dui là phòng mình có anh kia đang hát bài gì hào hùng lắm, rồi 1 ai đó đi ngang làm rớt phích cắm, tự nhiên cả phòng tối thui mất điện hết luôn. Từ đó, cả phòng k còn karaoke nữa :)))

3. WC:
- Sạch
- Cô lau dọn dễ thương lắm, hướng dẫn cho từng khách luôn
- Chỉ có điều có vài đồ đạc lộn xộn trong góc WC

4. Cuối cùng là đồ ăn nè: do hong có menu nên có món mình hg biết thịt gì (ăn ở đây thích lắm, mấy chị gái xinh đẹp phục vụ tận găng nên ngồi tận hưởng thoy, có phục vụ bóng cười nữa)
- Khai vị: gỏi bò trộn cùng 3 loại ớt chuông, hành tím ngâm chua, cà pháo, củ kiệu (rất ngon nha)

154.1,2,Went to this restaurant and ordered caramelized  tofu and mushrooms in a clay pot. It came out very fast. The pot was burning hot while the food itself was cold. It had clearly been microwaved. Besides that it was so salty and only came with 4 pieces of tofu. Not impressed at all. I don’t recommend this restaurant,
154.2,1,"Was once a pretty decent veggie restaurant. But standards have dropped such that I would never bother to eat here again. Smoothies made from unripe fruits and noodle based dishes served up with glowing red, artificial tomato sauce. No thanks",
154.3,1,"Very disappointed with the staff. I requested to add a plate of rice, the staff gave me one big bowl and when I requested if can give me smaller portion, they refused. The food is also nothing special in my opinion. Not going to eat there again.",
154.4,5,"I regret that why I didn't find it before even I am living nearby from one year. Luckily I was searching for restaurant to have dinner, and I saw this. As ex vegetarian, I felt so good after seeing it.
After going inside, I saw so many Vietnamese people coming to eat vegetarian food. And I was thinking before that Vietnamese don't like anything without meat.
You will hardly find any place to seat during peak hours. So I will not recommend it for date or romantic dinner :D.
Anyway food was awesome and very reasonable. Surprised by quick service though they have so much crowd. Nothing wrong items are served, no wrong bills are charged (which happens usually in crowded places). And so many varieties of vegetarian dishes are available. I would love to visit again and again.",
154.5,1,Bad service with poorest meal. Dirty. I make order for single and wait for 25 minutes to get a dish of cold rice a a small bowl of soup. Wait more 30 minutes for the main dish.,
154.6,3,Friendly but food was not awesome,
154.7,3,"Good food. However, customers need to be aware that some cookwares in use are made of cheap aluminum alloy which contains a lot of lead.  You can tell when aluminum utensils develop a black coating as in the picture.

Both lead and aluminum are very bad for your brain. Aluminum is known to cause alzheimer and lead poisoning can be fatal in the long term.  I had reminded the staffs several times but they don't seem to understand the danger to public health.  Will keep reminding whenever I stop by.",
154.8,5,only with vegs but still so good with many types of food!,
154.9,5,I really like the food and atmosphere here. Very peaceful,
154.10,3,"Nothing special about the place. The seatings are very nice and spacious, but the air condition only pointing to some location, so you better scout out the location before you pick the seat. The service were fast and friendly. Food is ok, little salty for my taste bit the sweet and sour soup was on point. Very average vegiterian restaurant to choose if you don't want anything fancy.",
154.11,3,The food at this restaurant is quite bland and extremely ordinary. With all the amazing flavors of Vietnam this restaurant is certainly lacking culinary creativity. Very disappointing! The positives are that the menu is extensive and the prices are reasonable.  FYI there is no alcohol served at this restaurant which absolutely did NOT influence my rating.,
154.12,5,"Good food and very affordable price. Vegetarian restaurant adjacent to a monastery, really worth a visit even for non-vegetarian! Very tasty!",
154.13,2,"Once again I was following great Google reviews and unfortunately I was disappointed. Firstly I perceived that as it was packed with Vietnamese it was a good sign and I was happy to choose this restaurant. But due to only Vietnamese guests and a fact the place is not on the 'foreigners' Saigon map', even though quite close to Bui Vien, the staff was obviously afraid to approach me as none of the waiters spoke English. It took them forever to take care of my order and I felt very uncomfortable as the waiters were always giggling when passing me as they were choosing who would have to take the longest straw and take care of me. Afterwards they also forgot to bring my drink and they served me with a ridiculously small amount of rice. Overall I was very disapointed. The meal was okay. But for the price approximately 70k for the Sechuan tofu I expected more when the restaurant wasn't on the main street and the service sucked.",
154.14,4,"Excellent vegetarian food at really great prices! Arrive was fine. The place was PACKED with locals at lunchtime, which is always a good sign. The seaweed tofu soup was particularly enjoyable.",

154.78,5,"The food was served quickly, and the food was delicious. Some dipping sauces seemed to be made of Wuxinsu. Vegetarian Wuxinsu in Vietnam seems to be fine, but we are from Taiwan, and Wuxinsu is unacceptable, so the dipping sauce It’s almost not dipped, only pepper, salt and raw chili are used. It’s worth mentioning that the raw chili here is very spicy. I don’t know if it’s because of the variety. There are a lot of dishes and hot pots. Unfortunately, we can’t understand Vietnamese, so we can only order food through Google to see pictures and tell stories. However, it is quite delicious, and the place here will not be difficult to find. , next time I have the opportunity to come to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I should still come to this restaurant to eat.",
154.79,5,"Không gian rất thoáng, có khu máy lạnh và khu ngoài trời cho những khách hút thuốc lá. Đặc biệt vào quán là được nghe nhạc thiền mở suốt, rất thư thái, dễ chịu.

Quán sẽ rất đông vào các ngày chay nên phục vụ có hơi sơ sót, còn lại những ngày khác thì có đông nhưng phục vụ rất tốt. Buổi sáng có bán các món nước như hủ tiếu Mỹ Tho ( nên dùng thử ) , bánh canh, cà ri, bún Thái ( với người ăn cay không được nhiều thì nó hơi cay nồng). Một điểm cộng của quán nữa là nếu đi ăn gia đình thì các món lẩu ở quán rất ngon. Đồ chay ở đây không hàn the, không màu đỏ lè, ăn rất thanh đạm và nhẹ bụng",

Cuối cùng chúng tôi phải bỏ món cuối cùng. Hỏi lý do sao có phục vụ tệ hại vậy? Giải thích: đông khách. Vô duyên, vì chúng tôi đã nhắc it nhất 4 lần và nhiều bàn vào sau cả nửa tiếng có đủ món trước chúng tôi nhiều. Tôi không thể giới thiệu nên ăn uống thiếu hoàn toàn khả năng phục vụ. Quá tệ!",

Tôi thích nhất món bún xào Singapore, bún miến và món đậu hủ chiên muối sả ở quán này. Điểm đặc biệt mang tính nhân văn nữa của quán này mà tôi rất thích đó là: Quán rất tôn trọng nhân viên giao hàng qua việc mời nhân viên giao hàng dùng trà giải nhiệt lúc trưa nắng trong lúc chờ lấy món tại quán. Khi tôi cùng người nhà đến quán để dùng bữa trưa trong thời điểm nắng gắt, nhìn thấy anh nhân viên shipper ngồi chờ với ly trà đá trước mặt, tôi rất xúc động vì cách kinh doanh có tình người của chủ nhà hàng. Nó toát lên cái tình giữa người với người. Hơn hẳn rất nhiều nhà hàng sang trọng thường coi khinh nhân viên shipper dù họ có đóng góp không nhỏ vào doanh thu của các nhà hàng đó.

155.43,5,"Nhà hàng món hoa
Nhà hàng kiểu sài gòn chợ lớn cũ, quán nhỏ nằm trên lầu 1. Do nhà hàng nhỏ nên đặt bàn trước khi tới ( nên đi nhóm đông người vì 1 phần thức ăn khá nhiều ), muốn ăn heo quay phải đặt trước nữa ngày ( highly recomended ). Quán gia truyền từ trước 1975 món ăn ngon đậm chất hoa, nhưng giá cũng rất chát ( quán như tiệm cơm nhưng giá của nhà hàng lớn như baoz ... ). Mọi người có cơ hội nên ăn thử để cảm nhận được ẩm thực sài gòn chợ lớn ( ngon đấy )",
155.44,4,"Món ăn đúng chuẩn người Hoa, món phải gọi là món heo sữa quay. Lớp da giòn rụm kèm lớp mỡ lớp thịt chấm thêm nước sốt rất tuyệt luôn. Những món mình gọi món nào cũng ngon. Vì là quán ăn gia đình nên chỗ khá nhỏ chỉ có 6 bàn nên ai muốn ăn phải gọi đặt trước. Đồ ăn nhiều nên đi đông mới gọi được nhiều món, đi ít ăn không nổi vì nhiều lắm.",

155.53,5,"Đồ ăn ở đây khá tươi và ngon, được chế biến theo phong cách của người hoa. Đặc biệt là món heo sữa quay, lớp da heo rất dòn và thơm, ăn không bị ngấy mỡ , chắc do được chấm với mật ong. Muốn dùng heo quay thì phải đặt trước ít nhất là 1 ngày thì phải. Các món ăn còn lại thì hương vị cũng rất ngon. Mình thích món cá ở đây. Cá rất tươi, chế biến xong vẫn có vị ngọt. 😋
Tuy nhiên là giá ở đây cũng hơi chát. Nếu đi 1-2 người thì không phù hợp j cả. Phải đi một nhóm đông người như đi gia đình, bạn bè thì mới hợp lý.
Một điều rất đặc biệt là quán nằm ở trên một tòa nhà như khu chung cư vậy. Khi vô cửa là phải đi lên lầu 2 mới tới quán. Nếu đi lần đầu chắc là sẽ ngạc nhiên. Quán mới sơn sửa lại nên nhìn khá bắt mắt và sạch sẽ.
Một điểm mình không thích lắm ở đây là dịch vụ giữ xe. Đã bị thu phí giữ xe cao trong khi ăn ở quán mà nhân viên còn khó chịu. Lúc lấy xe thì hỏi thẻ xe đâu nhưng giọng điệu thì là quát vô mặt mình ấy. Chắc lần sau có ghé thì sẽ đi grab hoặc taxi j đó cho lành.",

80 năm 3 cuộc tình...
Ăn cả không khí lịch sử của Chợ Lớn
Lịch sử quán này là ông ngoại dắt mom đi ăn
Mom dắt mình đi ăn ngày mình còn thiếu nhi. Giờ mình cũng đã có thiếu nhi mình dắt thiếu nhi mình đi ăn.
Chấm điểm: 9/10
Bồ câu quay: con non mới ra ràng, thịt mềm mướt rượt, gia vị ướp thấm vào từng thớ thịt con chym 🤪🤪🤪. Ngắt cái đùi cắn ngập răng mùi vị thịt ngấm vào tận tâm hồn...
Cua rang muối: thịt cua chắc, sốt muối có tỏi kết hợp với tỏi, muối, tiêu thơm lừng.
Mực lăn bột chiên: áo bột mỏng hơn tờ giấy, tôn lên sự tươi dai của mực, kết hợp với tương chua ngọt xay chung với gừng.
Dồi trường + cật heo xào cải chua: toàn bộ cái dĩa sẽ rất ngon nếu ko bị phá bởi mấy miếng cật. Màu sắc vô cùng đẹp nhưng xào chưa chín, xử lí mùi chưa khéo.
Đậu hủ tứ xuyên: người quảng đông chỉ nấu món Quảng Đông thôi.
Cải hồng koong xào: ngon, đĩa thức ăn bưng lên còn nóng hổi, cọng cải mềm mượt
Cơm chiên cá mặn hột cơm tơi mượt xào chung vói trứng đánh lên trước khi chiên cơm. Bỏ muối hơi lố tay xíu. Đánh muối ra chưa đều.

thức ăn ngon tuyệt vời, từ rau xào đến ốc đến cua. món heo sữa quay phải đặt trước ít nhất 4 tiếng vì hand-made hoàn toàn mọi công đoạn. lưu ý rằng nếu nhóm của bạn có ít hơn 6 người thì chỉ ăn 1 con heo sữa quay là no mà không đủ bụng để ăn thêm món khác.

Tuy nhiên nhà vệ sinh không được sạch sẽ, có rất nhiều mùi. Không thấy nhân viên dọn dẹp phòng vệ sinh dẫn đến khách xả rác hút thuốc bên trong. Nước xả có màu vàng như bị nhiễm phèn nhìn rất dơ.

Muốn gì lại nhà nó tìm đi. Tôi rất giận trả lời vậy số điện thoại của Anh đó đâu? Và Anh quản lý của các bạn đâu? Anh này trả lời tao nè. Có gì nói chuyện với tao? Rất hạnh phúc khi đến đây làm tiệc.

Food was okay, restaurant vibe was pretty classic but good enough for lunch meetings. I love the narrative from the restaurant though, she literally raised money from friends and strangers on Facebook to build this place. It is hidden charm in D3, you can find this as alternative with Cuc Gach Quan.",
159.2,4,"Depends on your dining purpose :) A great place, quiet, attentive, beautiful menu and display for dating or biz meeting. A pricey place for casual catch-up as as a local, it's easier to find those food elsewhere. Still, a lovely gem!",

159.8,4,"Had some vegan food here. The seasoning was a bit too strong and not to my taste, but from what I've seen they do make efforts to create original flavours and twist to all of their dishes. The waiter and waitress were a bit awkward, the food was a bit slow even though there were only 2 table at the time, maybe because they had to prepare for deliveries too (the place is initially a delivery business and still deliver besides serving customer at the restaurant). The place is quite spacious, well-decorated and can serve large groups.",
159.9,4,"Tasty food near where I was staying. Prices a bit high for Vietnam but nice indoor decoration, each dish minimum 150k. Total bill 500k for 3 dishes, drink and 1 dessert.",

159.11,1,"I came here to have lunch with my friend and her daughter in early May 2021. Ended up this was the most awful and disgusting place I have ever experienced. If you don’t mind to eat with flies, that’s the place for you. See photos as evidence. I addressed it to the waitress and she didn’t appear to understand it’s such a big hygiene problem.",
159.12,1,"The foods is not as good as expected and not meet the prices, too expensive with small amount. Spring rolls are in strange taste. The menu “salad” is just a joke (just corn and salad with boring taste).
Completely wrong to go here!",
159.13,3,"Traditional vietnamese food is served here. The restaurant has nice dekor and looks very pleasant, there is also an outdoor part wich is nice. When we arrived you could see some junk on the floor from earlier guests but otherwise ok. Some mosquitos at the place, probably because it was the rainy season when we were there. Saw anti-mosquito device in the restaurant but not enough to keep all mosquitos    away. If you want  traditional vietnamese cuisine this is the right place to go. Highly rated by Tripadvisor, maybe a little bit too high according to me. Restaurant can be  a little bit tricky to find because it's up the alley from the main road.",

We went there around 9am on a Friday, but we were the only customers and it was a very quiet and relaxing time.
There was no cafe where you could have breakfast nearby, so this store, which is open 24 hours a day, was very nice.

The ceiling in the store was very high and there was a sense of freedom.

I had a lot of jackfruit.
Breakfast was 55 kvnd with food and drinks, and the cost performance was very good.

Thức ăn khá ngon nhưng chưa thấy gì đặc biệt.
Còn bún đậu mắm tôm thì chưa đạt, loại bún chưa đúng, đậu cũng không ngon lắm.
Giá cả thì khá mắc.
Lên món hơi lâu.
Nhà hàng có lẽ sẽ thích hợp cho người lớn tuổi thích không khí miền quê thanh bình, chứ giới trẻ chắc sẽ không thích.
Dù không thích nhưng vẫn cho 3 sao vì nhà hàng cũng chưa có điểm gì đáng chê trách, chỉ là không phù hợp với mình thôi.",
159.99,3,"Mình tới quán lúc 3h , lúc này quán vắng , phục vụ quán rất dễ thương . Gd mình ăn sườn nướng mật ong ( theo khẩu vị mình thì ngon ) , canh sườn cải chua thì mình ko thích vì canh này có bỏ thêm cà chua và ngò gai làm mất mùi của cải chua và cải thì ko dc chua lắm , và món kgo quẹt ăn tạm ổn . Gd m ăn hết các món mà còn món cá tai tượng chiên xù đợi lâu quá nên đành nhờ bỏ hộp mang về vì ăn các món khác xong no quá , 1 phần là vì đợi món ăn ra hơi lâu nên ăn cũng mất hứng . Phần cá tai tượng chiên xù về ăn vẫn giòn nhưng mắm nêm chấm thì m thấy ko ngon.",

Tuy nhiên thức ăn không quá ngon, bị nguội. Nơi  xếp thức ăn để khách đi lấy thì không thoải mái cho lắm. Bàn sắp xếp khá san sát nhau, tạo cảm giác hơi mệt mỏi.Nhân viên thì không nhiệt tình.
Sau khi đi ăn buffe với giá 375k/ người thì mình cảm thấy giá mắc so với những gì mà nhà hàng đem lại được cho khách.",

159.104,1,"Gia đình tôi rất thích quán ăn này và thường chọn làm nơi họp mặt của gia đình trong các dịp vui. Sáng đầu năm mới, gia đình tôi cùng ăn sáng tại đây. Tôi đã gọi bún bò và xin một dĩa rau trụng chín. Khi và miếng rau và trong khi nhai, tôi cảm thấy như đang nhai một vật gì cứng. Vội vàng nhật ra thì thấy lẫn trong những cọng rau là một cây tăm tre. Tôi cố giữ lại cảm giác nôn ọe vì các em tôi chưa xong bữa.Tôi gọi cô tiếp viên đến và chỉ cho cô thấy, không nói không rằng, cô cầm dĩa rau đi. Tôi không thể tiếp tục ăn hết tô bún. Ngồi cho đến hết bữa không thấy một ai đến đổi tô khác. Cuối bữa, một cô tiếp viên đến dọn  bàn, tôi nói với cô rằng tôi không ăn hết vì trong tô bún hoặc rau có cây tăm. Cô chỉ cười cười rồi bột đi. Tôi lấy làm lạ, tại sao nhân viên của một nhà hàng nổi tiếng lại không được rèn luyện để có được phép lịch sự tối thiểu là nói tiếng xin lỗi khi vi phạm nghiêm trọng quy định về vệ sinh an toàn thực phẩm và cách phục vụ khách hàng. Gia đình tôi sẽ không quay lại nơi này một lần nữa. Tôi cũng sẽ khuyên các bạn tôi nên cân nhắc khi chọn nơi này, một nhà hàng thường quảng cáo về sự an toàn và cách phục vụ, nhưng thực ra là một nhà hàng không chuyên nghiệp, coi thường mạng sống và sự ủng hộ của khách hàng.",

Một phần buffet trưa là 400k/người, nhưng món ăn dân dã, hải sản rất ít, thịt ít, vào chỉ được món bánh xèo ngon, còn lại các món khác đều kém hấp dẫn. Số lượng món ăn ít, lượng thức ăn ít, theo tôi cảm thấy không tương xứng với giá tiền. Mắc mà không ngon.",
159.107,5,Đúng là không uổng công tìm tới nhà hàng trong con hẻm yên tĩnh giữa lòng thành phố này. Các món ăn giữ đúng hương vị truyền thống. Nhân viên phục vụ lịch sự và chu đáo.,
159.108,1,"Không gian tương đối ổn. Nhưng chỉ để vào ngồi nơi yên tỉnh và thư giản chứ vào ăn gọi món thì có nhiều thời gian để chờ đợi mặc dù chỉ là gọi những món ăn cơm bình thường đơn giản khg thể đơn giản hơn !
Hình thức tổng thể trông có vẻ quy củ của một thương hiệu nhưng thực chất không xứng tầm, giá cả và chất lượng không phù hợp , một món rau luộc chấm kho quẹt giá chót 115k chưa kể thêm món xào món mặn món canh ? Gia đình chỉ 2 người ít nhất phải mất tầm khoảng 500k cho một bữa cơm gia đình thuần Việt . Còn nếu không để tiết kiệm thử dùng một set cơm trưa tầm 80k rồi cộng thêm ly trà đá tới 10 k !
Mừng thay mức sống của dân lao động , trí thức ở cái thành phố Sài Gòn ta nay đã đạt tới ngưỡng này.",

Đi ăn tiệc cùng cơ quan, ấn tượng quán thiết kế ấm cúng, rộng rãi, bàn mình đi 20 người nhưng ngồi thoải mái, không gian sân vườn yên tĩnh không ồn ào, do đi đông nên ngồi ở trong, không gian ngoài giành cho bàn ít người. Về phần món ăn, món ăn chế biến ngon, tươi, hương vị đậm đà, không có pha chế bột ngọt nhiều làm khó chịu khi ăn xong. Tuy nhiên món ăn chế biến ít nên ăn cũng hạn chế khôg thưởng thức đã, giá cả thù hơi đắt.",

Nếu các bạn đi ít tầm 2 người thì theo mình nghĩ bạn nên order 1 phần cơm và 1 phần đồ ăn như cá kho tộ, hay Canh chua cá lóc hoặc gỏi là hợp lý. Lưu ý một phần cơm ở đây nếu có bạn có sức ăn yếu thì 2 người ăn là vừa đủ. Một điã cơm ở đây các bạn đổ ra tầm khoảng 4-5 chén (tụi mình gọi cơm chiên dương châu giá 75k). Nước thì cũng phải chăng chỉ 15k đối vs các loại nước ngọt. Chúc bạn ngon miệng tại nhà hàng Thủy Tạ !!!",

Một đĩa cơm chiên dương châu với thành phần bao gồm cơm, ít cà rốt thái vụn, trứng chiên thái vụn, ít đồ chua, dưa leo, 2 lát cà chua sống giá 35k. Quán cũng vắng khách, đa số mọi người mang theo đồ ăn. Tôi nghĩ sao quán không đa dạng hóa món ăn, hạ giá xuống bán vừa phải thôi. Ở quận 1 mà giá mấy đồ ăn tầm đó cũng chỉ 30k thôi mà. Bán thấp lại, lấy số lượng có khi doanh thu khá hơn. Kem trong đấy thì đắt khỏi nói, 30k cho một cây kem tươi 😅",

The restaurant deco had a modern Vietnamese feel but not overpowering with history and colours. The food was great. The shared dishes portion were plenty for 2. We enjoyed the chicken fried rice in coconut (recommended) and clam dish. In fact, we enjoyed all the food except for the fried frogs which was a letdown. If you in the district 1 area and done with eating street food, then I would recommend a visit to Den Long.",
162.2,5,"Had a great, reasonably priced meal here. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the decor was pretty. I ordered a soft shell crab, stir fried morning glory and caramelised pork dish with rice. The food was delicious and came very quickly. Would highly recommend for good Vietnamese food in a restaurant setting.",
162.3,5,"The food is well-prepared and so delicious!  I ordered the baked fish,  which tastes marvelous!  The interior is beautiful but not cheasy. The staff speaks fluent English, and very attentive.  And I think the price is reasonable. Highly recommend to the ones who want high-quality Vietnamese food in a comfortable environment with great service!",
162.4,5,"So good I came here twice. The food was faultless, absolutely delicious and so reasonably priced. The staff are beautiful people, so kind and polite. They made the experience 10/10. Highly recommend. Would have preferred if they didn’t use plastic straws in the drinks and the disposable wet wipes could have just been reusable napkins.",
162.5,5,"Coming from Singapore and into Saigon, we were absolutely blown away by the quality and service (us being foodies this is certainly not an overstatement). The menu had a great variety of dishes, reasonably priced (ard 100k per dish) and you get to dine in a clean and lovely decorated interior.

Staff were well-versed in conversational English and the food was served really promptly after ordering. They even gave us free desserts!

Thank you Den Long for the wonderful eating experience. We will definitely be back. (We had our dinners here two days in a row)",
162.6,5,The food is served relatively fast and tastes wonderful! Service is really good! It's really convenient to order as the menu comes with english translation and the waiter can understand and speak English. Love that the shop will go to every table to ask customers about the food being served. Can sense that they genuinely care about the customers. Would definitely revisit again to try other dishes.,
162.7,5,"Food was served quick and fresh. Taste really good at appropriate price point. Overall ambience is nice as well, shop is tucked right in the middle of a bustling street. Great stop to replenish energy ahead of a busy day!",
162.8,4,"The food tastes great, especially the crab curry with thick coconut milk flavour.

One of the staff speaks fluent English, and she even apologised to us very politely for the slightly long serving time due to many customers, and offered us desserts in compensation for mixing up our orders.

Overall a not-very-good but not-too-bad dining experience.",
162.9,4,"The food was superb as well as the service here. What was the most unique and delicious of the array of food I ordered was the Tonkin flower vegetable and the pomelo salad. A blend of sweet and spicy nature of the pomelo paired it greatly with the rice. The Tonkin flower, native to Vietnam, was a new and delicious taste. Everything else was superb as well and the service from the staff was great especially when the spring roll was slightly tough and they replaced them with a brand new replacement. Overall 9/10 would recommend for a traditional Vietnamese cuisine.",
162.10,4,"Nice clean place at first visit but your experience will depend on where you sit because they have 4 floors and the atmosphere is very different between them (the ground floor is best). The aircon is also very dry and not at all good for your nose in one of the backrooms (3rd floor, room without windows).

The quality of food depends a lot on what you order. The stewed pork is excellent but the fried calamari is plain boring. However, they do have the best soy sauce in town. I could eat two bowls if rice with the sauce and a beer. I would also include a plate of morning glory, that stuff is delicious.

Service is relatively quick but obviously will depend on the number of other guests. People here are friendly. The Lost in Saigon cocktail is a total killer so be careful to drink it slowly.",
162.11,5,"We came here on our first day in Saigon, and couldn’t have found a better restaurant for the evening! When you come in, you are immediately greeted by the friendly staff and nice atmosphere. It’s a cozy and nicely decorated place. Then came the food. The menu looked so good, we ordered 7 dishes to try as much as possible. And we were absolutely thrilled by the delicious variety! The sauces, the flavouring, the looks: all perfect. What made the evening even better was the extremely kind and friendly staff, who explained every dish and really welcomed us to the city. We will definitely come back 😊",
162.12,5,This restaurant has a beautiful ambience and clean. Even their toilet looks beautiful! Their caramelized pork is a must try! The staff can speak well in english that's why it is easy to communicate when you're a tourist.,
162.13,5,"We had a lovely dinner and it’s surprising us that all the food is so delicious. The staffs’s extremely friendly and take care of customers, I still remembered the waitress came up and ask us if the food is good or not. This is the first time I’ve ever had this experience at a restaurant. Make sure you make a reservation because this place is fully booked lately. We arrived last night but couldn’t come over so I have to wait until today. Highly recommend you guys should try all these Vietnamese traditional daily meals.",
162.14,5,"Reasonably priced, great taste and good service. The trifactor for any great restaurant. The dishes were well presented and portions were reasonable for 2 persons, but on the small side. So order a little more. They have many vegetarian options.",
162.15,5,By far the best Vietnamese cuisine I've had in ho chi minh city! The food is delicious and priced reasonably. Everything tastes superb. I will definitely come back again if I'm ever in ho chi minh again. Was even served complimentary dessert! Excellent service.,
162.16,4,We had a good experience eating here. The staff was quite nice and good. The food was good but nothing special. Everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their meal though. We did love the starters though and the local IPA beer was quite good as well.,
162.17,5,"It was an amazing experience coming to Den Long! This was our second time here after previously visiting four years ago, and the food remained just as good.

The staff were fantastic and incredibly polite, and the food is some of the best in Vietnam at a very reasonable price.",
162.18,5,"Good food, love their pomelo shrimp salad, coconut chicken fried rice, and the caramel pork :) the chicken a bit too hard (hard to chew) but overall taste ok. Portion a bit small , price is fair and affordable. Will come back again when next visit hochiminh 👍 friendly customer service",
162.19,5,So yummy food. And so many options. We should have gone like five times to understand the culinary pleasure fully. But even the one night we stayed was perfect. We managed without reservation but I'd recommend to do one to be sure you have a table,
162.20,5,"I was here for the last vietnamese dinner with a couple of friends I met during my trip. Perfect spot, extremely welcoming, super nice staff, very very good food. It in the district one of Saigon and also the walk to reach it is very nice. I would definitely come back if I’ll be back in Vietnam one day!",
162.21,5,"Didn't have any idea what foods they serve at first. When we saw the menu, it looked a lot like Thai or Indonesian authentic cuisines. So we tried several foods: squid, shrimp, clams, and tonkin flowers.

And they are all surprisingly perfect! It tastes right for our Asian pallette. The seafoods were fresh. The drink was good too.

The staffs were very helpful and friendly.

Overall, it's  a nice experience eating there.",
162.22,5,"Exceptionally good food, service, and warm ambience without breaking the bank.

Wife and I normally read reviews with a grain of salt, and therefore came with average expectations... and oh boy... were we blown away!

This won't be a lengthy review, but us coming  back for the second time (perhaps 3rd?) says alot about the food at Den Long, the founder Dave, (super friendly and even gave us gastro tips as to where to dine in Vung Tau, and also a brief history as to how DL came to be!) and the amazing service crew.

Also a special shout out to the budding accountant Long (I hope we got your name right!) Who told us about the HCM's war museum and with that lovely chat in general.

Brilliantly cooked food. Check! Super service. Check! Cosy and friendly ambience. Check! The Golden Buzzer from us. Check!

We will not hesitate to recommend this lovely eatery.

N.b. Not sure what that luscious, homemade green condiment that came with the grilled pork ribs and pomfret is called. But we love it. It's piquant, with a hint of lime and with the right balance of spiciness and sweetness.",
162.23,3,"Very clean and friendly staff who speak pretty good English. This restaurant seems to be mainly for tourists. When I ate there, I did not see any locals. Although reasonably priced, food was not too impressive. I ordered a duck hot pot, which was quite overcooked. Since I cannot eat spicy food, I asked to make sure it does not have hot pepper in it. But it tasted very spicy, and I couldn't eat much. If you are looking for a dining experience similar to what you have at  a Vietnamese restaurant in Western cities, this place is perfect and the price is probably better.",
162.24,5,"The Owner and the Staffs here serve us with compassionate in everything. The atmosphere, the food, the people are on point. We came last night with no reservation, and we just only waited for few minutes to get the table. The restaurant itself shows a  home-coming energy for us, last night was quite busy but the Staffs did it with calm and generous (they speak English pretty well).
The price is affordable for us to enjoy our experience in Vietnam.
Lovely place, lovely people.",
162.25,5,"Amazing place!!! Just delicious food, cooked and served really good! Fried rice was amazing, caramelised chicken and pork were soft and delicious! We enjoyed this meal
They have a good Wi-Fi and personal speak English really good. Also the food was prepared pretty fast.
It's possible to pay by card (Visa)",
162.26,5,"The best vietnamese food we tried during our stay and very accessible flavours for tourists who are not yet used to local flavours and ingredients.
The restaurant is set in a reasonably well located area in ditrict 1 and the decor is vibrant and warm.
We would recommend their mango sea bass and stir fried pumpkin flower (quite garlicy), along with they fresh juice and ice teas.
Great experience and lovely staff!",
162.27,3,"beautiful space, slightly pricey and found the coconut fried rice to be quite overrated. there was a coconut fragrance but not much flavour. oyster was small, best dish we had was the grilled prawns. definitely a restaurant targeted to tourists",
162.28,5,"Food pricing:
1. Glass Noodle With Crab Meat - 155,000 VND. I find it so cheap for this dish and there numerous chunks of crab meat in it.
2. Crunchy Vegetarian Rolls - 89,000 VND. Nice tofu fillings with crispy exterior, don't think you will be disappointed eating spring rolls in Vietnam.
3. Caramelised Pork - 89,000 VND. Can probably give this a miss as the sauce is passably tasty but the meat is rather tough.
4. Garlic Morning Glories - 89,000 VND. Super refreshing and crunchy. How come their vegetables are so tasty?
5. Sticky Rice with Banana and Coconut - 39,000 VND. Lusciously decadent.

All in all, we spent about S$31.00 on this meal. So happy with the pricing. And, the place is so beautiful",
162.29,5,"Food was perfect and service was really great from the staff. They even have handwritten guides on things to do and great food places in Saigon!

Didn’t get to take photos of all the food since we were too hungry that we devoured all the dishes. The pricing is really affordable for such a restaurant too! Highly recommended if you’re in the area :)",
162.30,5,"Found this place after searching through Google reviews, and it didn't disappoint. Nice decor, air conditioned, attentive and friendly staff, lots of options, and most importantly, the food was delicious. I didn’t book before going, the place was full and waited for 10 mins but didn't mind waiting. I went there a 2nd time in 3 days to try other food, and they served me a complimentary small desert saying thanks for coming back which was a nice gesture remembering who I was.",
162.31,5,"We went there for our last supper in Ho Chi Minh, had summer rolls, grilled pork skewer, and beef steak, and rice. The summer roll was a nice size with chewy rice paper, good amount of local herbs inside. The pork was ok but the steak was something else. It was so tender and cooked in perfection, the sauce had a good kick to it and those on the steak (raw garlic, ginger and chilli I assume) were so tasty I could put some on the rice to eat.
Staffs were very friendly and helpful, spoke good English.
I’d happily go back next time I’m in Saigon.",
162.32,5,"A very nice restaurant with great food, friendly staff who could converse well in English. Ordered the platter as a starter - nice. Main dish is the seabass fish with mango sauce - fish cooked perfectly well with sweet, hot & tangy sauce. Ordered morning glory for vege. Drinks - 1) peach iced tea with lemongrass, kumquat, and slices of peach and 2) passion fruit juice. Dessert is sticky rice with banana and coconut. Price is reasonable for 2 pax with 3 dish, 2 drinks and 1 dessert, vnd 570k. A must try restaurant in HCM.",
162.33,5,"We came here on a Saturday 05/11, walked in without any reservation around 6pm local time. The restaurant wasn’t too crowded and there are available seats. Ordered 4 dishes & 1 rice for two pax and total bill is around VND500,000 ++ (can’t remember exactly). The food is good, squid is fresh and pork is tasty too. Only the wrap is hard (I think because it was served first and we did not consume immediately as we waited all to come and take photos). Price is decent for a proper meal here + ambience here in HCMC.",
162.34,5,"The food was super tasty, but the portions were a bit smaller than expected (taking into account the prices), at least for the catfish and coconut fried rice😅 it’s good we ordered a lot of things.

The pomfret was very good, but the sauce was super spicy, even if I ordered it just a bit spicy, so take care if you don’t eat spicy food. Other than that, the fish was very good.

The rice was also very good, a bit sweet from the coconut, but I didn’t particularly taste the chicken. Don’t take this as a main course though, it’s not that big, at least if you’re hungry.

The pomelo salad was super fresh and tasty. Had some pork pieces inside, super tasty all together.

The passion fruit mojito didn’t taste very passion fruity, but it was good.

All in all, with all the buts, the food was very good. 👍

The waiters were also nice and friendly.",
162.35,5,Nice place with Hoi An-style decor and cuisine. They have very friendly and helpful staff. I recommend trying out their roll platter.,
162.36,5,"Super friendly staff (they offered me a drink)! Good food and fair prices. The decorations are pretty.
This is a lovely restaurant.",
162.37,5,"One of the tastiest meals i’ve had in vietnam. The crab meat was beautiful and the curry itself was lovely and creamy with a nice amount of vegetables.
Very pretty setting with friendly and attentive staff.
We were a group of ten and everyone praised their meals.
Great job !",
162.38,5,"I ate here 3 times during my stay in Ho Chi Minh, and each experience was outstanding. The staff are very friendly, and the food is amazing! Everything is reasonably priced, and super tasty!!
10/10, would highly recommend!",
162.39,1,"Don't understand the good reviews. Had lunch here and the food was bad. The seasonal special, the cha ca la vong came to the table cold, was greasy, and only contained very small pieces of fish, some of which were mostly fat. The price is also much higher than other places. Save your money and meals and go get something much better in one of the more local restaurants nearby.",
162.40,5,"It’s the people who make a place home and I’m absolutely floored by the service here. Not only were the dishes truly homemade as touted, this particular staff recommended places to go to and eat just like an old friend. Handwritten notes are always up my alley and these were jotted down so kindly by him. Love the idea of being able to write down well-wishes and hang them on a branch as well. I was too hungry for my usual food shots but everything was brilliant. They seem to be aware that people may not appreciate their salty cuisine and they left the fish sauce as a side for their veggies – a gesture which I found especially thoughtful. Thank you for the wonderful experience!",
162.41,3,"To me it was a forgettable meal at a high price tag for Vietnamese standards. The food is just okay, delicately prepared and missing the touch of local street flavor (lacking a good char and having a muted flavor profile). Adventurous tourists may find more unique and afforable option on the streets or at local eateries. I get why the rating is high at this place - great service, clear english menu with description, good ambience - a very pleasant experience for tourists who miss such comfort/ luxury while travelling. :)",
162.42,4,"Nice, ambience, food, and drinks taste just average. Our bill was too high as it contained items we didn't order. They corrected the mistake after we notified them about it.",
162.43,2,"Meat is too tough. Fish is not fresh. Shrimp is good, and the salad is okay. Thanks for the dessert for compensation in the end, I increase the score from one star to two stars.",
162.44,5,What a fantastic place for lunch!! I had the fresh springrolls with a passionfruit virgin mojito. Both had so much flavour… very tasty!! The staff were also very friendly and the place was nicely decorated. All in all a great place for food in Saigon!!,
162.45,5,"The seafood is fresh and well cooked. Staff are responsive. Nice environment and music. Overall great.

I did not like that 10% tax was not included in the price, but you know when you get the bill",
162.46,5,"I liked the restaurant. The food was good, the staff super friendly and professional.
I recommend if you are nearby",
162.47,5,Amazing place.  Just a beautiful place the inside is gorgeous.   Food is great.  The menu has some history in it.  Just a 5 star place.  Highly recommend,
162.48,5,Glad we stopped here for lunch. The food were yummy and reasonably priced. The staff were attentive.,
162.49,5,"I guess it lives up to its reputation. A stunning place BUT you should book ahead! We were lucky enough to secure a table without booking, but I know not to test that much again next time.",
162.50,5,"I stomped across this gem when looking for a place to eat late afternoon, and I can only say I had the best duck I have ever had (sorry grandma). The restaurant was completely empty when we were there (bc I think it was around 4pm, weird time to eat 😬). Deco is always nice with some quirky dragon pictures on the walls …",
162.51,5,"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. High quality food, lots of flavour, each dish comes with a special sauce , the fried tofu deserves an award, it’s so unique and delicious. The entire menu offers various of delicious dishes, we ate around 6 different ones and all were outstanding. The homemade tea also incredible, if you’re looking for a place to eat, you need to come here. From the presentation to the service and food, it’s the best. Thank you !!",
162.52,5,"Accidentally found this restaurant on our last day trip in Ho Chi Minh. Their food is tasty, nice ambience with decor and lanterns.  clean environment, staffs are friendly and able to speak English.",
162.53,5,"I have never in my life had tofu cooked this way! Simply delicious. Moderately priced, worth every penny. Very nice atmosphere. Vy Nguyen gave me awesome recommendations, so helpful when hungry and not yet aware of the local cuisine 👌🏻",
162.54,5,"Few restaurants offer vast  vietnamese dishes in Saigon because every dish offered on the menu has to be done right. We (party of 5) decided to visit this restaurant without a reservation. The restaurant was full but we were seated after a short wait. We're happy to report that the dishes resemble the thorough-designed menu. The food was delicious and authentic vietnamese. The plates were presented expertly. Portions were on the smaller size and the prices were not low but not excessive. We learned to expect this combination in D1 restaurants catering mainly to tourists. This is not a knock on the restaurant. If you want this kind of quality and tell your friends back home about VN dining experience, you will pay for it. Moving on, the service was courteous and prompt. The decor was tasteful and the traditional music backdrop was chosen carefully. We will come back again.",
162.55,4,"Air conditioning, bathrooms very clean. The food was great. Good portions. Tried the crab, clear noodles dish and a coconut cocktails. Both very good.",
162.56,5,Excellent food and service. Nice interior decor and ambience. I would highly recommend this restaurant.,
162.57,5,"Yummy food, great service. All tasted really ‘clean’ and good quality!",
162.58,5,"We came across this by chance as we were in the area. The food and decor is lovely but the portion sizes are pretty small, everything was tasty and definitely worth a visit if your in the area.",
162.59,5,"Delicious food and amazing service! The 1st time we got free rice and the 2nd time we went, they recognized us and we got a free plate of clamps! Thank you for the great experience!",
162.60,5,"Den Long was absolutely amazing! The restaurant is gorgeous--bright, airy, and located in a great area of the city. Our group got a number of dishes to share and were impressed with every single one. I really enjoyed the crunchy tofu with salted egg sauce, the coconut fried rice with chicken, and the mocktails! The menu is expansive, so come hungry for sure.",
162.61,4,"A lovely meal on our last night in Saigon. Wish we came here the first day! We had spring rolls, pomelo salad, deep fried sea bass and pork skewers. All were very good. Overall, the best meal we had in Saigon. It was clean, fresh, tasty. The staff were very helpful and spoke quite good English. Make sure you come here on your trip to HCMC.",
162.62,4,"Staff was very friendly and polite - especially Lam. We was funny and pretty flirty.
The restaurant is huge (I think at least 3 floors) and was very crowded. It’s very pretty from the inside.
I’m vegetarian and unfortunately it had a lot of meat of seafood options with pictures. But I noticed that’s often not the case for the vegetarian dishes. Pictures make it so much easier to choose from by a glimpse instead of googling it.
The food tasted good but was for me not special. Our cocktail tasted good but very strong.
The prices are a bit more expensive.",
162.63,2,"Hoped for a nice meal here but wasn’t as good as hoped. First issue was when we ordered a bottle of white wine. Waitress brought us an opened bottle of red wine. We immediately said we ordered white and were rudely told we had ordered red and we had made a mistake! Ordered chicken curry and a crab curry. Started eating the crab curry which didn’t taste right. Queried and was then told they had made another mistake and given us frog curry. They took that away and we then had to wait quite a while for the crab curry so our other food was spoiling. When we got the crab curry, the flavour was nice but there just wasn’t much crab in it. We also didn’t get very much rice. Other silly things like cracked and chipped sauce pots on our food wasn’t particularly hygienic or safe. On a positive note the mixed starter dish was quite nice. Just a shame the service wasn’t very good and food could have been better.",
162.64,3,"The atmosphere is great, albeit it can get crowded, so a table reservation might be necessary.
I ordered a coconut fried rice with chicken. The presentation was really nice but the food itself was less so. There were only a few pieces of chicken meat and some coconut flakes sprinkled on top. I can't say I would recommend it to anyone unless it's for taking photos. Consider picking something else from the menu.",
162.65,5,Everything is excellent but service is the best! Tonkin flowers are my fav in Saigon.,
162.66,5,"I love this restaurant at the first time
Came here twice during my staying in VietNam. The foods are really good , lovely presentation and reasonable price.
If you are foreigners, don't be sorry because staffs can speak foreigners languages well.
Well training staffs too.
One of my favorite restaurants in Sai Gon
Recommended👍",
162.67,5,Dinner prepared with fresh and high quality ingredients. Staff was very nice. Highly recommended place!,
162.68,5,Very good food and service. Loved the combination of morning Glory with garlic and garlic fried rice. The caramelized chicken was also really good. The only dish I wouldn’t really recommend is fried spring rolls (they were ok but not as good as the rest),
162.69,5,"Was here for dinner.

Great variety of food. The soup was very appetising and it goes really well with the rice. The meat dishes were tender and juicy.

The shop was well decorated and service was great.

Definitely will come back for this",
162.70,2,"We are very disappointed.  The service was ok, but we ordered two no alcohol mojito and got one with alcohol and one totally different drink. After 15 min, I get a new drink. Then we ordered rice, and they forgot us to tell that the rice is out of stock. So we are waiting 20 min for the rice. And the best of all, we give the first meal back because it was not really heated.  After 15 to 20 min we got a new meal and it although was not really heated! The taste of the food was good but the waitress was exerted but this was all!
Sorry but for this price it's was really a really disappointing experience! Not again. We got a discount of 15% from the restaurant, this was ok.",
162.71,5,"Normally, I’d post the food picture but it was so good we ate it before I could snap a picture. Definitely worth the stop.",
162.72,5,"Great place!

Stuff is very polite and speaks English very well. The food is delicious and you don't have to wait for a long time to get it. The prices are fair for a restaurant.",
162.73,5,This place is great! Food was fantastic- amazing flavors. Service was friendly and helpful. Really sweet people. It’s NOT expensive- just not street food prices. (89-120) You’re in nice restaurant. Highly recommend.,
162.74,3,"The decor, service and menu are all aimed at the tourist market, as reflected in the clientele.

Probably very good for families or first time visitors, but not somewhere that would draw us back.",
162.75,5,"This Vietnamese restaurant’s food actually taste a bit like Thai food. Not your typical Banh Mi or Pho joints. The food here is slightly on the sweeter side, but still a delight. The staff are super friendly compared to other Vietnamese people we met.

Soft shell crab and coconut fried rice were quite nice!",
162.76,5,Amazing food. This is probably the nicest food we’ve had in Vietnam. The staff are incredible friendly too. If we’d eaten here at the start of our time in Ho Chi Minh we probably would have come here every night!,
162.77,4,"Forgot to take food photos till the end, good location 👍 but the most impressive thing to me that tiny elevator and air-conditioning not cool enough 😑",
162.78,5,"I loved this place.

Super impressed with the host taking me through the menu and talk about some of his favorite dishes. Started off by asking if I had any allergies and then got straight into it.

Great English and easy to understand.

Food was awesome - ordered the prawns, crispy chicken and a peach drink which was amazing.

Do yourself a favor and when in Ho Chi Minh City go check out Den Long. You’ll be pleasantly surprised.",
162.79,5,"Colorful place with lanterns all around. We had the appertizer plate, pork skewers, grilled chickend and pineapple rice. All was very good. The Lost in Saigon cocktail was fantastic. Definitely back for more",
162.80,5,"Highly rated restaurant in Saigon, sour fish soup, stewed chicken and seafood fried rice.
All of them were well seasoning, not too over or too strong taste, balance with each other.
The aroma of Saigon beer was very cool, forgot the name but it was the third place of craft beer at 3.5% alcohol. Recommended for female to try, light and smell good.
Btw, waiters and waitress are excellent English speakers, no communication issue at all.",
162.81,2,"We agreed via email that they would decorate the table and prepare a cake for a birthday dinner.

But they forgot, so no decoration nor cake.

After complaining they offered 20% discount on the dinner, which is a nice gesture but of course doesn't make it up for our ruined evening.

What a pity.",
162.82,4,"These place is superb. Very kind and polite staff, always crowded with many people dining here.
Ordered fried tofu, vegetables, fried fish, soup with shrimp, fried anchovies, steam vegie with fish paste. For drinks we order tropical fruit and IPA beers. All taste good and tasty.
Price also acceptable with that kind of portion and environment. Location easy to find.",
162.83,5,I came here for dinner. A lot of food to choose from. I enjoyed the soup as it goes really well with the rice. Meat was tender and juicy. Staff was very friendly. I will definitely bring friends here for a meal.,
162.84,5,"Delicious food, super fast and friendly service 😃 the waitress even gave us some
Tips for saigon & a small Vietnamese lesson 😜 …",
162.85,5,"Phenomenal!! Tiny portions in the Hue style, good enough to try a range of dishes. Prices are a bit higher than average, but the atmosphere, service, and food are all absolutely top notch. Really quiet and relaxing. The fried pineapple rice was perfectly crispy, and the house style fried beef had this ridiculously tasty sauce. I’ll be back.

I’ve photographed the menu - take a look.",
162.86,5,"Visited to taste local food, good food and staff. 👍🇻🇳🪷
Coconut was superb 😁",
162.87,3,"Food was so-so. No need to come here if you think you are going to have a really authentic Vietnamese meal. We ordered spring roll(beef), Pamelo salad, caramelized chicken and fried shrimp spring roll. The chicken was too salty and sweet. The price is not expensive so can’t complain too much.",
162.88,4,"Very yummy food with a beautiful and tasteful decoration. The staff was very kind and offered to give recommendations that were great. I really enjoyed the rice crackers for starter and the yogurt with passion fruit was to die for. If you don't like too much sweet, remember to tell them as drinks have quite a lot of sugar.",
162.89,5,Food was well cooked & beautifully presented with a “home” feel. Place is nicely designed. Dave & staff are very attentive & friendly.,
162.90,5,"Great food, attentive and friendly staff. Ordered mixed spring roll platter to start, grilled fish, pumpkin flower with garlic and lemon grass pork ribs. All great except there wasn't much lemon grass flavour to the ribs but was delicious nonetheless.",
162.91,5,"The food was amazing. Really tasty and the service is really helpful. The prices are fair.
Would go there again if I came back to Saigon. And even the restaurant is located on a big street. It's really quite inside.",
162.92,3,"Very tourist-orientated food, in other words, safe choice for tourists as the only spices they use is garlic, sweet&sour or soy sauce. The food is okay but wouldn't come bac. Very average taste like any adapted Asian cousin for Europeans. Plus the photo in the menu differs substantially from what you get.",
162.93,5,"sauce was perfect, meat was very flavorful,  great service, pretty lanterns inside",
162.94,5,Best food experience so far in Vietnam!,
162.95,1,"Don’t go - this restaurant is a tourist trap. The food tastes really bad and it honestly feels like a trap with expensive prices.
We ordered the duck with shiitake mushrooms and lotus flower. The duck didn’t taste good and there were no shiitakes at all. We told the waiter who said that it had been braised into the sauce, but the sauce was clear as butter with not a single sign of mushroom. On the picture in the menu you could see big pieces of mushrooms, so probably just a bad excuse..",
162.96,5,They were nice enough to accommodate us as a walk in whilst being busy with tour groups. Food was delicious and well presented. Staff were helpful providing recommendations around HCMC.,
162.97,5,"Good ambience, friendly staffs and speaks good English. They will explain and recommends some dishes for you to try. I'd personally think the taste of the food here has been slightly tweaked to cater for the foreign market. I like the pamelo salad, unique taste. The price is a bit on the high side but not overly expensive.",
162.98,5,"The staff spoke English, were friendly and professional. They were helpful in recommending dishes when unsure which was nice! Food was good, would come back again!!💯",
162.99,4,"Hidden amongst busy street in Ben Thanh area is the Den Long restaurant. Most commendable is the helpful and friendly staff who guided me through their menu with detailed explanation. Their waiter speaks good English which helps a lot to tourists. I had tried a few of their specialty such as  chicken fried rice in coconut, pan fried Tonkin flower with pork and mango salad with grilled shrimps, all of which is quite good, though the fried rice is a bit bland. Another recommendation is their house special coconut coffee, small cup just nice after a sumptuous lunch meal. Overall a wonderful experience of Vietnamese food.",
162.100,5,Very clean place with excellent service. Staff speak decent English and suggest how to eat the traditional dishes. The mango salad was just wow! Grilled beef was juicy and tender. The caramelised chicken was slightly tough and sweet.,
163.1,4,"Absolutely delicious food, but sad that they didn’t have the duck (which is on the menu on the website)",
163.2,4,"Pretty good overall. Their strengths are with seafood dishes. Others aren't so exciting.

Outdoor seats facing the peanut shaped building across the road is enjoyable.",
163.3,4,"Cơm tấm is amazing!  Meat was super juicy, fish sauce is well-balanced (not too sweet), has slices of tomato & cucumber as well as a soup aside.  Price is 55k, quite high comaparing to other options in Saigon but you really get what you pay for.  I don't like the floor, a bit dirty because it's a seafood resraurant for events, partys, meetings as well so they have seafood tanks that sometimes the water spills over the floor, you sit far enough to not getting it splashes on but it doesn't look nice.  Maybe I'm a bit picky but other than that, things are generally nice!",
163.4,1,"Absolutely horrible service. Steamed fish arrived to the table after over an hour. Fish was uncooked, however I was instructed to pay for it since “it is already on our table”
Other food was fine, but being screwed for 700,000 does not deserve a single star…",
163.5,5,"Met a group of friends for dinner. Food was good, service was slow maybe too many people at that time. Overall, we were happy -:)",
163.6,3,"Duck leg noodle shop was good, prawn dumpling is average. Food serving speed was very slow",
163.7,4,"Expensive restaurants with many types of exotic options. The prices are ridiculously high, but the service is top notch. Food quality is hit-or-miss. Not recommend for expats. Very suitable for client meetings and such.",

163.16,4,"Their Vietnamese food are awesome, really good, no doubt on it.  But the pan fry food are not that great, I tried one of their pan fry noodles, doesn't taste good at all.  But over all, this is a great restaurant to go to.  Very big and spacious!!!!",
163.17,5,"Taste good, services good.",
163.18,5,"This restaurant is always an A plus. It's not a typical ""quán nhậu""(restaurant where you can have special dishes) you see on the street. The food is extremely yummy, tasty. The price will be  $$ to $$$ but I think it's worthy. One thing I like is the serves are all so nice and extremely professional. They can provide you some information about the food or suggest what courses are the best to eat. ( Catch of the day).
This restaurant has 4 buildings and they are all next to each other. You can't miss their flashy neon signs when you pass.",
163.19,3,"Expensive, the food is often over cook",
163.20,4,"I prefer to rate 4.3 stars for this place. Everything is ok, esp services and waitresses are very helpful, except some equipment are out of date, look old or lost its funtions.
Food in this restaurant is excellent, you can try variety of Vietnamese dishes, all material are fresh and clean.
It also have a good place for parking, the fee is equal to the others but I wonder why I park on the street also have to pay money for parking, it is public, not belong to the restaurant, so awkward!",
163.21,5,Just went there for a bowl of noodle soup and some dim sum for lunch. Overall good experience.,
163.22,4,"The food was good for the low price. The service was a bit slow and it took a long time to get our food. If you are looking for a place with air conditioning, decent food, low price, with low price alcohol bottles like Johhnie Walker to drink and sit around for a long time then this is a spot.",
163.23,4,Good fresh food located at great location. Street parking for cars. Price is not too expensive either. They also have live singers is you want to sit outside,

Bún gạo nước lèo chỉ có cái bánh chiên có nhưn đậu xanh hạt là ngon, nước lèo không bột ngọt thì ok nhưng vị ko được ngon. Quán dùng nấm đùi gà cho các món hơi nhiều, mà nấm này không có vị gì, nên món ăn nhạt nhẽo vô vị.
Có quầy tráng miệng nhưng đồ ăn không đậy lại, lại để khu vực đường đi qua lại cảm giác không được vệ sinh, nên có nắp đậy lại thì tốt hơn. Nhân viên không giới thiệu cho khách dùng các món này, ai không để ý sẽ bỏ qua.

164.32,2,"Chào chị chủ nhà hàng Quỳnh house,
Mình là thực khách đã ăn ở nhà hàng của chị cùng với gia đình.
Mình xin góp ý với chị như sau:
1. Về món ăn:
- Món nem vuông: nem tạm được nhưng chiên ngấm nhiều dầu, rau nghèo nàn và không được tươi.
- Món cơm lá sen: cơm rất tệ, giống như cơm để lâu, không phải mới hấp lá sen, nguội, cơm rời rạc và cứng.
- Món nấm đông cô kho trong nồi đất: rất nguội, giống như kho sẵn trong nồi lớn rồi múc ra nồi đất nhỏ.
- Đậu hũ đút lò: thực sự là không phải món đút lò, mà là đậu hũ cây non với rau củ nấu sẵn, múc ra bọc trong giấy bạc, chứ ko phải bọc trong giấy bạc rồi đút lò.
- Bông cải xào tiêu xanh: mình đã dặn kĩ nhân viên là xào bông cải xanh, ko ăn bông cải trắng, nhưng khi mang ra thì bông xanh thì ít mà bông trắng thì nhiều. Trong mô tả món ăn cũng ghi là bông cải xanh.
2. Menu khá nghèo nàn về món ăn rồi mà nhiều món còn ghi là tạm ngưng không bán nữa. Hơn nữa việc ghi Giá trên menu chưa tính phí phục vụ và VAT sẽ làm cho thực khách không thoải mái. Nhân viên có giải thích là các nhà hàng khác cũng làm như vậy. Nhưng thực tế không đúng vì chúng tôi là những thực khách đã đến rất nhiều nhà hàng chay ở Việt Nam và các nước khác. Đa số họ ko làm vậy. Mặc dù giá trên menu khá mềm.
3.Cảm ơn chị chủ đã thiện chí mời 3 ly trà lipton gừng mật ong.
4. Cảm ơn nhà hàng và nhân viên đã tặng hoa 8.3 cho 2 cô cháu.
Thực sự nhà hàng chay thực dưỡng sẽ là rất tốt nếu gieo duyên ăn chay-thực dưỡng cho thiện khách, mình cũng kỳ vọng Quỳnh house sẽ là nơi mình sẽ đến nhiều lần nhưng tiếc là chưa được như kì vọng.
Rất mong là Quỳnh house sẽ lắng nghe góp ý của khách.
Trân trọng.",

One of the popular resraurant that is always crowded at night.",
165.2,2,"I heard that it was delicious, but it was very ordinary. Considering the price range, the cost performance is not high.
And, the customer service level is very low.
When they dine as a guest, they may not be able to think about what the minimum service is like.  I don't think I will go to the restraint myself.",
165.3,5,"I really miss eating peking duck 3 ways: duck skin wrap, duck meat with noodle or rice, and duck bone in soup or hot pot. Not sure why no restaurants that I have been to in the US cook peking duck this way. My favorite is always the skin wrap, but I'm a little sad that they don't prep the skin at your table anymore. The fermented tofu hotpot with duck bone is very delicious as well. The cua lột with salted egg sauce is very good too. Service is a little slow.",
165.4,4,"Nice place for chinese food, their menu is so various thay make us hard to choose. It’s also a common place for dining at night, they even open the whole night till the morning. Food quality is good enough, staff service is ok.",
165.5,5,"One of the restaurants open late night in HCMC. Mì vịt tiềm was delcious; tasty broth with plenty of duck meat (noodles were also perfectly cooked). We also ordered the banh canh gio heo and mì hoành thánh.  Banh canh was okay, but definitely would choose the mì hoành thánh over banh canh.",
165.6,5,2am in HCM and hungry after Club: stay at tan hai van. Many specialities incl shark fin soup. The black chickens also very famous in here. Try it out!,
165.7,5,Came for the Tim sum here.. food is below quality compare to other specialist in dim sum dim tu tac . Environment is OK.,
165.8,5,"Havent been back in years, yet the food still taste delicious like usual!!",
165.9,5,"One of the OG Chinese-Cantonese restaurant in HCMC. For those who like having supper, this place opens late to satisfy club goers as your last stop supper spot before heading back to sleep.",
165.10,4,"Situated in D1, so that explains the high price. But the managers can speak Mandarin as well as Vietnamese. We believe Cantonese as well.

The crab dongfeng is extremely delicious... We have not tasted any other Chinese restaurants coming close to it in the years we've been in HCM. Of course it comes with a price, depending on the crab's weight.

Try the black pepper beef. Not like other beef.. They cook it such that it still has chewyness and tenderness in it and with the spice of the black pepper, wow!

The jielan when we 1st saw it served, we were quite depressed as it was only just stalks.. But unlike other restaurants, they were soft and we ended up clearing the entire dish.

If you are into Chinese food, this is the place to go, but be willing to pay.

For non smokers, please let the staff know, else u will have clowns who will puff away in the air conditioned place.

Update in June 2023: restaurant now has a stage on level 2 with singers but I find my favourite Crab Vermicelli has deproved greatly , maybe they have changed the chef. The price was still high,  probably that explains the crowd.",
165.11,2,"This place serves great seafood fried rice and mafa-tofu. The restaurant is clean and so are the restrooms. However, the kitchen is in another location outside the supper room, therefore the food is cooked and brought through the broad outside street. It seems like they do not know the problem of this serving manner. While the food is brought to the table from the kitchen, it will be sprayed with all the pollutants in the street and this place just serves it haha. If this was okay, I would hadjust eaten on the street. I did not just pay to eat inside, but also to eat that are cooked and served properly, also with the kitchen windows and doors closed. If you wanted to show your cleasiness of your kitchen, at least install a glass wall please.",
165.12,5,Best Chinese food in Saigon. Menu is variety and price is decent. They're open 24/24 which is good for tourists who looking for restaurants late night.,
165.13,1,Service is possible the worst I've experienced in my life. Food is mediocre. Would not recommend this place. To rub it in they charge 10k for motorbike parking as you leave.,
165.14,1,The staff could not speak proper English so thought we ordered a dish that we didn’t want to. They didn’t want to take it back and we had to pay full price for it. The noodles tasted like instant noodles. The chicken that was served with it consisted mainly out of bones. Would not recommend to eat here. You had to pay extra for the napkins they put on the table and they don’t have change if you pay separately.,
165.15,1,"Ohk. First of all, i cant deny the food taste great. Just wondering how long it take to cook 2 salted egg buns and a plate of stir fried noodle?  Well im sure its wont take longer than an hour. Sitting here looking at other people who got here later than us but got their food serve first is really annoying.
Never eat here again",
165.16,5,The food here is diverse to my taste and the price is not too expensive. The hidden duck noodles here are great😋😋👍👍 …,
165.17,5,"This is a great Chinese restaurant, I highly recommend you should go here and try special here. And then when you finish the meal, you should order Tofu dessert with coconut milk and sugar ginger. Another thing is Kim Sa Bao as well",

165.19,3,"It's a big disappointment coming back after a long time.
Some dishes have no taste at all, and some are extremely salty.
It's overrated and doesn't taste like Cantonese food at all. Never come back.",

165.21,4,Dimsum and Mapa tofu is the best!!!,
165.22,5,Best chineses food in Saigon. Open 24/24,
165.23,5,Best Chinese food I've ever had in Saigon! Highly recommend,
165.24,5,Awesome dimsum and chinese food. Service is slow,
165.25,5,A place with super good food like: black chicken steam with herbals. Nice noodle and many special foood. The price is good and reasonable. Citizen usually come here after they party or hangout . Cause this restaurant open untill 5am,
165.26,3,The food part of this place is that it's open till very late at night. I found the food just average but the portion was big. The service here was fast and they understood our orders without us needing to explain a few times.,
165.27,2,"Had some dim sum at this place... looks good just not my taste... pork is really gamy. Soft shell crab is really floury if you want to go somewhere really good go to ""Ngan Dinh Saigon."" Not a far walk from Liberty Central Riverside Hotel!",
165.28,5,My favorite Chinese restaurant in Saigon. Will definitely be back!,
165.29,5,A good central chinese restaurant. Service is slow,

165.31,5,Love the food here. Very fresh and tasty.,
165.32,3,"Little cowed even at 8p.m. Lucky I made reservation. There were flies everywhere. I thought its top restaurant based on the review. The food is just OK. Nothing special or stand out. I ordered perking duck and couple of dumpings, chicken feet. Not recommended perking duck. May be they were too busy, so the service not good.",
165.33,5,"Great food, decent service and love the ambience!",
165.34,4,"Food is ok, served fast, not too good compared to other Chinese restaurants, and price is not cheap at all. But the space is quite nice, staffs are friendly and helpful enough.",

165.45,3,Nice location. Food and cooking are ok. Not cheap prices. Not comfortable seats. Not clean place. Not nice service. Should improve washroom.,
165.46,4,Delicious meal with original china taste.,
165.47,3,Foods were good but they had us sit on the upstair where there was a bad smell and the seats were not comfortable.,
165.48,1,"Not such a good food, very bad not next time",
165.49,1,"The worst food I've had in my 2 weeks in this city.
Ordered chicken and vegetables, soup and for vegetables ordered some okra (lady fingers).
The chicken was completely flavorless and tough. The soup was so overly sour I couldn't even eat it. And the okra (which I was expecting to be healthy), was breaded and deep fried.  Bottom all the 3 dishes tasted horrible, and the bill was about $30 usd. They also included a 5% service charge however the service was pretty bad as well, all the staff seem to be rude or in a bad mood.  Never again!",
165.50,1,"It’s been a couple years before I went back to the restaurant. Unfortunately, I’m so disappointed with the service and food here. We had a family meeting at the restaurant last week. Here are all we received from the restaurant:
1. Slow and neglected service: all servers were standing in the front and kept chatting to each other, they didn’t pay attention when we needed them. They also gave us an attitude when we asked them to refill hot water in teapot.
2. Ordering: I asked them to give me sometimes to review menu and discussed to my family, he, however kept standing next to us and rushing us to order. That way made me feel rushed and uncomfortable.
We ordered water bottles, they didn’t have enough, even though we only ordered 5.
We ordered beer bottles, they brought out cans saying they ran out of bottles. Fine.
3. The food was fairly ok, but it was overcharged in compared to the quality.
Beijing duck is the only nice dish in my opinion. Everything was fine until vegetable stir-fried noodles of my mom came out, half of the vegetables smell bad (the smell like when you store vegetables for too long and its getting mouldy) and taste sour. We spoke to supervisor, he insisted that was the way vegetables were. My mom told him to smell the vegetables, he said he would inspect the kitchen, but never came back till we were about to leave without a proper response.
4. Come to the bill: they charged us bottles instead of cans. It’s unbelievable. Not too much to pay, but the way they’re serving customers and stealing little money from them are not the way a fancy restaurant in heart of saigon should do.",
165.51,2,"Seems a very popular place so we decided to try it. In short, the food is not very good, the serving sizes are very small and it is way overpriced. This view is held also by my Vietnamese girlfriend  It is however conveniently open late.",
165.52,3,"Recommend Beijing duck, chicken salad and dim sum. Broken tables are a disappointment. Staff can be more approachable. Open for 24 hours so the place gets even busier after 9 pm to cater for bar and restaurant staff who have finished their work but have nowhere else to go.",
165.53,5,"I waited a long time before reviewing this restaurant, mainly because it is so busy. This is hands down my go-to spot for late-night food, dim sum breakfast, and Chinese seafood. The service here is on point.
They normally get busy around 11pm after the dinner rush because this is spot to hit after a night on the town. My friends and I have been here dozens of times. It has never let us down. From fresh juices to beer. Noodle bowls or fried rice. This is the spot.
I have so many pictures I will just post the most recent with this review. I highly recommend the banh cuon chien XO sauce. All the dim sum is on point. Soups, family style dinners... Fresh seafood! Just let me know if you like the food here. I'll invite you back for a feast!
Highly recommended. Will return many many times. A+++Xem thêm",
165.54,2,"Not very good and ridiculously overpriced. I went here with my someone and we ordered 4 dishes: a plate of fried rice, some stir-fried kailan with garlic, Kinh Do pork ribs & shrimp wrapped in tofu skin. Now I get that Chinese cuisine can be very oily but everything here was drenched in oil  (that kailan dish, GURL). And then the price. Also GURL. There are several upscale/casual places that serves the same cuisine with better quality and with half the prices: Va Thành, Madam Oyster. Does not recommend and will not come back.",
165.55,4,"All best Chinese food here!
Quick service with delicous hot dishes!

Minus 1 star since all waiters try to persuade us to most expensive choice (!)
Even I try to tell that only supper.meal a simple waton noodle but he ask me to try king schrimpt many times...
Seem they love high bill than loyal customers (!)",
165.56,4,Poor ducky,
165.57,5,gud place 2 come when  u visit Ho Chi Minh city,
165.58,4,"The food had a lot of flavor. Ordered black chicken soup, banh canh cua, schezwan fried chicken and squid, oc huong snails (very spendy), crab congee, and sapoche smoothie. All the food was delicious. Service was good and food served timely and hot. The place is clean. Great place for foreigners to have Vietnamese food or Chinese whatever you like. I like to eat where the locals eat and so give it a try.",
165.59,3,"Dim sum mostly average. Hair in the har gow. Service inattentive. Disappointing because dinner was quite good. But, salted egg bun was terrific.",
165.60,1,Staff is not friendly. We got half of our food because the waiter didn't wrote it correctly and had to wait more than 30min after we asked for it.,
165.61,3,Dishes are great but we need to wait for too long.,
165.62,5,Best Viet Chinese Food in town,
165.63,5,24 hr. Chinese Restaurant.  They have the best Wondton & noodle soup! My favorite.  You will find a lot of people after clubbing or karaoke rendevous there.  Highly recommend going here.,
165.64,3,Don't put so high expectation also .,

165.67,3,Not really good taste,
165.68,5,"The Peking Duck here is PERFECT and a must try

first the skin is wrap with rice wraps and served as a dish,

then some of the flesh is being stir fried with noodles and served as 2nd dish.

The rest are all deep fried with garlic and chilli, making it one of the best DUCK dish I've ever tasted !

Coming from Malaysia where we do have an extensive choice of chinese food, this still surprise me.

Service and Ambiance is not worth a mention, as all Chinese restaurants spot the same quality, it's the norm.",

165.75,3,The food is okay but the price too high,
165.76,1,"12.45pm ,  i arived here with my family with a two year old kid. After making order, the manager appeared and said that they close, don’t receive order. Then I go to the Din Ki restaurant opposite. I saw that people still come in Tan  Hai Van. What happened???",

165.107,5,Various kinds of duck recipes. The ducks are really huge and delicious. A good choice for your dinner,

165.109,4,Food is ok. Ask price before ordering. It can pricy.,

167.30,3,"Mình mua về chứ không ăn tại quán
Quán chuẩn bị kỹ, có cả bao tay để bóc
Hào cỡ bt như ngoài quán ốc phần này 12 con 199k tặng thêm 6 con tính ra hơn 11k 1 con giá phù hợp với sz hào chứ không tặng thì có thể gọi là mắc.
Vị ăn ổn cơ bản, chưa đặc sắc",

Quán có nhiều promotion mà gọi món nào trong promotion là hết :)))
Sốt cajun làm mình thất vọng, dù nhân viên bảo là best seller. Món crawfish không có gì đặc sắc.

Cảm giác vào ăn quán mà như đi ăn xin vậy.
Thái độ phục vụ thực sự không thể nào chấp nhận. Nhất là cô quản lý/nhân viên nữ mặc áo đỏ (chắc chuyên order). Nhân viên gì mà khách nói không cần quan tâm tới nhu cầu của khách, coi khách như đi ăn xin và cứ liên tục cố tình ""gài"" khách những thứ cô ấy muốn.
Thiếu sự chuyên nghiệp và tuyệt đối không có chữ tâm của người bán hàng.
A chị em nếu còn muốn có một không gian ẩm thực, văn hoá mà muốn được tôn trọng thì xin kiếu nhà hàng này đi.
Không hiểu sao giữa đất Sài Gòn này những nhà hàng tệ hại vậy vẫn có thể tồn tại được.
A horible experience!",

Phục vụ khá lâu nên phải gọi món trước nếu đi nhóm, ai đến trước nên gọi món trước. Bạn cũng nên đặt bàn trước vì cũng đông đấy. Có món tôm càng size bé nó có xíu thịt thôi, các bạn dùng sẽ hơi hụt hẫn vì 20% thịt thôi, còn lại vỏ càng 80%. Còn vài món mãi ăn quên chụp. Miếng khô hải sản ở đây làm cũng khá ngon, mua miếng tặng cơm và cơm cũng ngon. Món sốt cay có ốc hương với mực bao ngon, cay bao đã.",

167.41,4,"Nhà hàng là loại hải sản khá phong phú, do ban đầu đây là một vựa hải sản online chuyên bán hải sản tươi sống nhập khẩu, sau này mới mở nhà hàng để tận dụng nguồn hàng giá rẻ để kiếm thêm, thức ăn nấu hợp khẩu vị người Việt, không bị Tây hóa quá mức. Ngoài ra nhà hàng cũng rất cố gắng đa dạng hóa menu, các món khác ăn cũng rất ok nha, cơm chiên hải sản với tôm và cồi sò điệp ăn ngon, hạt cơm tơi xốp, mực khổng lồ (180k/con) ăn cũng ngon, thịt mực dày cắn ngập răng rất thích hợp với một người thích ăn mực như Hải ngoàm ngoàm",

Tuy nhiên thì tôm hùm đất sốt cajun ko hợp khẩu vị mình lắm, thôi thì chắc do mình kén ăn quá, nó dầu mỡ cực kì ý, tôm lại ko thấm sốt nên món ăn, tôm đằng tôm, sốt đằng sốt, nhạt nên dù cho bánh mì nhưng mình ko thể nào ăn được. Thôi thử 1 lần cho biết cajun là gì thôi. Chúng ta ko thuộc về nhau.",

2 người ăn xong thì còn đói, gọi thêm 1 phần bò beefsteak mới đủ cái bụng! :(

169.14,1,"Mình và bạn bè ăn 2 thố cơm chiên cá mặn, và khoảng 5-6 lon bia. Tổng chi phí 1,7 triệu đồng????
Lúc gọi có kêu 1 cái lẩu, trong menu có ghi rõ là 650 nghìn đồng, nhưng mãi không thèm đem ra. Mình bảo rằng thôi trễ quá cho huỷ. Vì buổi chiều mình bận, không thể đợi. Bạn chủ quán kêu đã làm xong rồi nên không thể bỏ được, bắt buộc mình phải tính tiền. Mình dù không ăn nhưng vẫn ok, bảo đem ra tính.
Kết quả hoá đơn ghi là 2 ký lẩu cá khỉ gió gì đó, mỗi ký 650k (chứ không phải lẩu 650k như ghi trong menu), và tổng cộng là 1,3 triệu đồng cho nồi lẩu không khí đó. Mặc dù ngay từ đầu mình đã khẳng định là 1 lẩu. Bạn bán hàng nói “bên này đã nói 2 lẩu mà chắc bạn không nghe”. Ủa chứ mình là người mua hay mấy bạn là người mua? Mấy bạn bắt trả tiền 2kg là mình phải trả 2kg?
Mình cũng nén giận bảo ok thích bao nhiêu chả được rồi lấy tiền trả. Bảo bạn đó gói lại cho mình. Bann đó bảo “mấy bạn của anh nói là để đó chiều ăn” (mình đi cùng đối tác). Mình nói ok.
Nhưng sau đó không còn cái lẩu nào cả. Bạn mình đi ra thì chả ai biết tới sự tồn tại của cái lẩu 2kg 1tr3 đó hết.

171,"Rice paper is relatively chewier than regular ones, and comes with a mountain of a variety of herbs that you can include in your wrap, along with pickled veggies, cucumbers and bean sprouts.

The Bo La Lop is pork wrapped with betel leaves, very juicy and fragrant when combined with crushed peanuts. Pork Cha Gio and Crab Cha Gio both had great crispy texture, but the latter was a little bland. Nem Nuong was moist, savory with a hint of sweetness. Pig Ear and Hock were tender, with the crisp of the cartilage.

The Bamboo Nuoc Mam Salad was also very addicting, a perfect balance of sweet and umami, served with shrimp chips.

172,"Quán Làng Ta ở Khu Trung Sơn, ngay Đường số 1 (Bình Chánh).

Bạn đi vô đường số 8, rồi đi vô Đường Số 11 là thấy liền (không phải bên mé bờ sông đâu nha)

Tại đây, không khí mát mẻ, rộng rãi vì có cái hồ nhỏ nhỏ ngay giữa, và chòi lá bố trí dọc hồ.

Thức ăn ở đây giá khá ok, bia giá cũng không mắc. Tuy nhiên nếu đông khách thì bạn chờ đồ ăn hơi lâu, nên gọi 1 lúc (và đồ ăn sẽ lên 1 lúc luôn).

Thích hợp đi nhậu bạn bè, hay gặp gỡ ăn uống gia đình. Không thích hợp với nhậu đối tác hay dạng sang trọng nha

À! Thức ăn cũng bình thường, chứ không có món nào nổi trội lắm. Nói chung là ăn được, không xuất sắc.

Nếu ai tìm quán mát mẻ, ngồi uống lai rai thì ra đây là OK

Vừa mới đến cổng là bạn sẽ bị hấp dẫn ngay bởi không gian thư giãn tuyệt vời tại đây, một không gian mà bạn khó có thể tìm thấy tại mảnh đất đông dân này.
Câu cá thỏa thích, không gian tĩnh lặng thoáng mát
Khai vị cùng nhiều món cực kì hấp dẫn, dĩa nào kêu ra cũng khá là lớn với rất nhiều đồ ăn bên trong.
Nếu đến quán bạn nên gọi các món mang hơi hướng thôn quê. Nhất là câu cá lên làm các món gỏi.
Thành phần chính của các món gỏi này là thịt và các loại rau thơm cùng dấm. Một món khai vị không thể tuyệt vời hơn dành cho bạn khi đến với quán. Trộn đều các loại thức ăn lên, cho thêm một chút nước mắm chua ngọt nếu bạn nào thích đậm đà và thưởng thức thôi. Thịt dai mềm vừa phải, đậu phộng béo béo bùi bùi, mùi thơm nồng từ các loại rau thơm, tất cả tạo nên một món ăn quá tuyệt vời. Dùng nhắm với bia ướp hoặc rựu hột chuối rừng là nhức nách luôn.",5

Love this place! Delicious food. This place gets quite busy fast and almost all the time, so be ready. I would recommend that they remodel or clean up the restaurant more, especially the floors. They’re always sticky and dirty.",4

173,"I went there with a big group of about 12 people. We ordered almost everything they have. For it's price, the place has really good food. The frogs tasted fresh and the staff were friendly. The worst one was probably the salted egg one. The rest was really delicious. None of the dishes were really spicy (as I'm not good at eating spicy food). The place looks a bit sloppy and not very clean. Keep in mind that this place only sells food with frogs. If you have never tried frog meat I would recommend this place.",4
173,"They know how to make a great taste of frogs!
Good price. Variety dishes. Smoothies and tea from drinks menu are delicious, but out of order sometimes.

173,My go-to place for butter-fried frogs. That thing is amazing here. The flavour has always been on point. The frog rice is an another great menu item here. The sauce that is used to coat the rice is just bomb. Service is great and quick. Although the restaurant's cleanliness could use some improvement.,4

173,"Các tín đồ mê ếch không thể bỏ qua nha
Biết quán lâu rồi, lại cực lỳ gần nhà chưa tới 1km , mà giờ mới đi ăn được, mình rất thích ếch nhưng vợ mình thì lại không
Nay mới có dịp rủ đứa bạn thân đi thử
Nhân viên nhiệt tình, phục vụ nhanh, thích cách lên đồ ăn tại quán, thực khách ăn gần xong hay xong mới lên món, nhiều quán lên 1 phát như ụp vào mặt
Đồ ăn ngon nha mọi người
Chắc sẽ còn quay lại với đứa bạn thân chứ vợ là thua rồi hahaa",4
173,"Đường vô rộng nhưng hai bên xe oto đỗ rất nhiều nên bạn nào đi oto cần chú ý chút nè.
Xe máy để ngay trước cửa, bên ngoài quán không nổi bật lắm.
Đồ ăn ổn nè, mình đi team 26 người đặt 5 món ( mỗi món 4 phần) kèm nước => đủ no nè
Nhân viên phục vụ nhanh.
Điều mình chưa hài lòng lắm đó là chỗ ngồi khá chật ( chắc tại mình đi đông ) hok có lối đi lun.
Thích hợp ăn trưa cho team dưới 10người nha mọi người.",4
173,"Mình ghé đây lần đầu nhưng có lẽ không ghé lại nữa. Do là không hợp khẩu vị thôi chứ không phải do lý do tiêu cực nào. Là nhà hàng nhưng không gian khép kín có máy lạnh. Rất bất tiện cho người hút thuốc như mình. Thời điểm mình tới thì quán chỉ có đúng một loại bia. Đồ ăn cũng gọi là ngon nhưng mình lại không hảo ếch lắm nên ăn thì thấy cũng giống giống nhau. Có nhiều loại cơm chiên, mình gọi cơm chiên trái dứa. Tức là cơm chiên bỏ trong vỏ dứa, vì mình không quen ăn cơm có ngũ vị hương nên không thấy ngon lắm. Nhân viên thì nhiệt tình nhanh nhẹn. Giá cũng ổn hợp lý không đắt mặc dù vị trí quán ở quận trung tâm!",3
173,"Đồ ăn ngon, giá cả phù hợp với vị trí trung tâm. Tầm trên 100-200k tùy món.
Không gian quán như quán ăn bình thường, không có gì đặc sắc, sẽ khá chật khi đông khách.

Phục vụ lên món nhanh
Mình đi vào cuối tuần nên hơi đông.",4
173,"Đồ ăn ngon, nhìn chung chất lượng đồ ăn 8/10. Tuy nhiên cơ sở hạ tầng quán thì hơi cũ và không được tươm tất lắm, lễ tân thì mở nhạc buồn thôi rồi, toàn nhạc thất tình, nên đang vui đi ăn cũng hơi tuột cảm hứng, nhạc không phù hợp không gian. Nhân viên thì ngồi trên bàn khách nhìn hơi kỳ, cũng không chú ý khách vào để tránh chỗ, bù lại phục vụ món nhanh.",3
173,"Quán vẫn ngon như ngày nào. Cuối tuần rất đông khách, mọi người nên đến sớm.",5
173,"Order món ếch rang trứng muối, báo hết nên đổi sang món ếch đút lò phô mai cũng báo hết.. Sau đó gọi món ếch rang muối tiêu Hong Kong và chờ đợi rất là lâu tầm 45 phút vì quán không thanh toán bằng thẻ nên bạn mình đi bộ ra đầu đường rút tiền rồi quay trở lại đợi một lúc lâu nữa mới có món ăn.. Lúc đó thì có khách vào ngồi bàn bên cạnh bàn mình, order ếch rang trứng muối, mình vẫn nghĩ bạn sẽ báo hết rồi nhưng không, bạn phục vụ đó vẫn nhận order và 2 phút sau đã có??? Không tin được ạ! Mình có gọi bạn order lúc đầu cho mình và hỏi tại sao thì bạn đó nói là do bếp báo bạn đó ngưng nhận order, còn món đó có lại thì bạn đó không biết. Nghe vô lý cực kì vì nếu ngưng nhận thì tất cả các bạn phục vụ phải biết và có món trở lại thì tất cả cũng phải biết. Nếu bạn báo là món đó sẽ có nhưng phải chờ lâu mình cũng sẵn lòng ngồi chờ. Như thể bạn thích thì bạn báo món đó có, không thì thôi vậy. Chưa kể có bạn phục vụ khác bưng đồ ăn cũng không biết bàn ăn của quán đánh số như thế nào phải đi hỏi lại.. Mình đã định gọi quản lý hỏi nhưng thái độ thiếu chuyên nghiệp của các bạn phục vụ thì quản lý cũng vậy nên thôi.. Mình đến lúc 8 giờ tối là giờ không đông khách, lúc đó vẫn còn 3 bàn trống, nên không thể đổ thừa do đông khách được, trong khi nhân viên nhởn nhơ nói chuyện, ra xem đá banh.. Cảm giá lúc đó rất là tệ nên các món đã gọi không thấy món nào ngon cả!. Anh bảo vệ lúc đó đang coi đá banh nên mở loa rất lớn, cứ 10 phút mình lại nghe thấy quảng cáo trang web nhacai88 gì đó, rất dễ hiểu lầm là quán đang quảng cáo cho web đó. Mong quán xem lại.",1

Món Ếch trứng muối là chân ái.
Cháo ếch hơi không đúng vị singapore, dù đã dặn lấy cay nhưng ăn vẫn ko cay.
Ếch khá tươi và ngon",5

173,"Quán ếch làm đồ ăn ngon và đã ăn nhiều lần. Món cháo ếch và ếch trứng muối ăn ngon và đặc biệt.

Tuy nhiên không gian quán cần nâng cấp, gần đây bước vào hơi có mùi và phục vụ khá tệ. Khi khách order chờ không thấy lên món dù đến sớm hơn các bàn xung quanh, nhưng các bàn xung quanh lên liên tục và nhanh hơn. Quán nên biết chủ động xem lại khâu phục vụ để cải thiện dịch vụ.

Phục vụ: 1/5
Đồ ăn: 4/5",2
173,"Ếch tươi, món ăn tương đối, giá hơi cao, quán phục vụ chưa tốt lắm.",4
173,Quán ếch xanh không gian ấm cúng. Các món ếch rất ngon. Đặc biệt ếch rang trứng muối. Nước sốt trứng muối cực ngon,5
173,"As a frog restaurant, the food tastes better than I thought. The service is similar to other restaurants. Good food to eat as a delicacy",3
173,"Quán chuyên các món từ ếch, và nhiều món khác nữa.
Nên ăn thử",5
173,Món ăn ngon giá rẻ. Ngày lễ có chương trình khuyến mãi. Thịt ếch tươi ngon.,4

173,"Quán ăn quen thuộc, món ăn rất ngon phù hợp với khẩu vị của mình",5
173,Quán ăn ngon. Đồ ăn rất tuyệt nhưng nhân viên lơ là như là không muốn làm nhường nhịn lẫn nhau dù đứng 3 đến 4 đứa thấy khách vào vẫn cứ nhìn lên trời nên thấy có 1 số khách vào mà không gọi nhân viên là cho ngồi chơi xơi nước luôn dù mấy đứa đứng đó có 3m. Bó tay chỗ này. Vì vậy có vài khách vào thấy ngồi lâu tự bỏ đi luôn không quay lại. Có lẽ chủ quán trả tiền thấp nên làm kg nhiệt tình lắm. Kg biết quán có tồn tại lâu được kg với cách làm kiểu này,2
173,"Nhà hàng phục vụ khách rất tệ, lừa đôi khách hàng.
Order món ếch rang trứng muối, báo hết nên đổi sang món ếch đút lò phô mai cũng báo hết.
Sau đó gọi món ếch rang muối tiêu Hong Kong và chờ đợi hơn 45 phút.
Một bàn khác, bên cạnh bàn mình, order ếch rang trứng muối và 2 phút sau đã có.
Rõ ràng nhân viên yếu kém, phục vụ thái độ lừa dối khách hàng.
Mình đến lúc 8 giờ tối là giờ không đông khách, nên không thể đổ thừa đông được, trong khi nhân viên nhởn nhơ nói chuyện, ra xem đá banh.
Không nên đến đây ăn.

=========
It’s terrible and cheating service restaurant.
I ordered “salty egg fried frog”, it’s out of order, so I changed to “cheese frogs”, it’s out of order too. Finally I chose “Hong Kong pepper salt fried frog”. I had to wait for 45 minutes.
A table next to my seat, order “salty egg fried frog” but they were server after 2 minutes.
It’s obviously bad waiters in this restaurant and I felt I were cheated.
I came here from 8PM, this time is not usually crowed. So they cannot claim that it’s over crowed. While I were waiting for so long, their employees played and watched a football match.
You should not go to this restaurant for a nice day.",1
173,Nhân viên rất bấm điện thoại. Order ra món rất thái độ.,1
173,"Mình đã từng đi chi nhánh ở Quảng Ngãi nên hôm nay kiếm ở Sg ăn vì thèm . Đến quán ấn tượng đầu quán hơi cũ và nhỏ nhìn không sáng sủa hay sạch sẽ lắm . Menu hợp giá tiền tuy có mắc hơn menu mình đã ăn ở QN và có tính  thuế Nhân viên phục vụ không nhiệt tình lắm , món ăn lên nhanh . Nhân viên bảo vệ không dắt xe hộ khách chỉ ngồi ấn điện thoại chơi game . Nói chung ngoài đồ ăn ngon thì còn lại mình chê :))",3

Nhân viên phục vụ chậm và thái độ kém, ngồi cả đám nói chuyện với nhau, khách gọi order thì mặt nặng mày nhẹ đến như người ta vào ăn xin của quán. Tự cộng hóa đơn VAT ngoài, đưa thông tin xuất hóa đơn thì ù ù cạc cạc, bảo sẽ gửi qua mail, 1 tháng sau vẫn không thấy mặt mũi hóa đơn đâu, hóa ra là bóc lột thêm mỗi khách đến ăn 8-10% VAT 1 cách kín đáo à.

Đã ăn và thích một số món như ếch xào trứng muối, ếch ủ rơm, ếch chiên giòn, cháo ếch Singapore... Tiếc là lần ghé gần đây không bán món ếch nướng muối ớt nữa.

Nhân viên phục vụ khá làm biếng, hay chơi điện thoại. Đĩa khách ăn xong không tự giác dọn để rộng bàn mà chỉ khi mang thêm món lên mới dọn, trong khi quá khá vắng, nhân viên khá rảnh rang. Sẽ không ghé quán lần nữa. Rất thất vọng khi đây là quán ăn ưa thích của cả nhà mà chất lượng thì xuống cấp quá.",1

Mệt quá hỏi bé nhân viên áo xanh thấp người sao lâu quá vậy e? Nhỏ thay vì sorry khách vì chờ lâu thì đáp lại bằng cái mặt cực kỳ khó ưa ""xung quanh chị nhiều bàn còn chưa có món nào kìa chị""
Ha..ha.. NH kiểu này nên dẹp sớm đi ha, never come back!",1

173,"Phục vụ quá tệ. Thật sự rất thất vọng so với lần đầu đến ăn. Khi chúng tôi order thêm, thái độ phục vụ rất tệ. Ghi order quên và dù nhắc nhiều lần vẫn lơ. Khi mang các món ăn ra bàn, phục vụ đưa chúng tôi tự đặt xuống không mở miệng nói câu nào. Thái độ phục vụ rất không thể chấp nhận được.",1

Tên mấy món đã ăn là ếch sốt trứng muối, ếch sốt phomai, cơm chiên cá mặn. Đi 2 người mà ăn 3 món no lặt lè luôn. Một điểm cộng cho quán nữa là nước uống lạ, ngon. Sẽ ghé ủng hộ nữa",5

Nhân viên của quán chưa được thân thiện cho lắm.",1
173,"GÓC TỨC GIẬN _ Quá cho khách hàng trái nghiệm tồi tệ - ẾCH XANH - 371D NGUYỄN CẢNH CHÂN

Thái độ nhân viên quá chợ búa, quá bất lịch sự, mình chẳng cần phải xem “khách hàng là thượng đế” đâu nhưng ít ra phải có chút tôn trọng khách hàng.

Hôm nay mình có đi ăn cùng chị & em gái ở NCC. Chờ rất lâu mới ra được món đầu là ếch sốt trứng muối, ăn xong chờ thêm tầm 20p nữa vẫn chưa có món thứ 2 - món ếch phô mai đút lò. Nên chị mình có bảo nhân viên, bạn ấy đi vào nhưng không biết có nói lại bếp hay không nhưng vẫn chưa có món. Cả nhà mình chờ tổng cộng hết chắc hơn 30p :))) lúc này chị mình có bảo lại nhân viên lần nữa, lập lại y như lần 1 và ĐẶC SẮC HƠN LÀ CÓ MỘT NHÂN VIÊN NAM NÓI RẤT RẤT TO “LÀM LẸ CHO KHÁCH KÌA, KHÁCH NÓI KHÔNG LÀM THÌ TÍNH TIỀN ĐÒI ĐI VỀ Á” nói giọng điệu rất là mỉa mai và cả nhóm nhân viên cười hí hửng :))))
Và lần nào mình đến quán cũng không khỏi thất vọng cách nhân viên đối đãi khách như vậy, những lần trước có thể vi vu cho qua nhưng lần này thì KHÔNG THỂ VÀ RẤT QUÁ ĐÁNG. Quán thì đông nhưng lúc nào nhân viên cũng xúm chùm lại nói chuyện hoặc bấm đt.
(Ở đây chỉ có một chị gái xinh xinh là phục vụ đỡ nhất thôi) còn lại thì thật kinh khủng",1

I am sitting on the curb.
theserver kept refilling our beer which is very rare in vietnam.
can try again",5
174,"Service was very good. We sat outside, little polluted but at least there was a slight breeze. Food is good there, had a bit of everything.",4
174,"This place is so bad. I have no idea how it has higher ratings-- perhaps my experience was just particularly bad.

Ironically,  most of the seafood was sold out. The food was very bland and was more filler than main dish (i.e.: more vegetables than noodles). Food took incredibly long to come out, and we ended up cancelling 3-5 dishes because they were taking so long, despite being non-seafood dishes. The fried rice was also gross, not sure why... Our fried fish (with veggies and rice paper for rolling) came with plantains but it was unripe and left my mouth shockingly dry.

The wet wipes cost money and a bottle of water is overpriced. I understand this is a ""higher end"" place, but this was so bad. For the same price at home (America), I could get something that tastes way better.

The service was terrible. I watched our food be brought to another table before they said it wasn't there's. It took over 10 minutes to get the check calculated. One member of my party was missing plates and dinnerware. We had to ask 4 times for it to finally be brought out. My parents were yelled at by staff for looking at the fish tanks.",1

I don't usually write reviews on here but why I have to asked to put ice in my cup. It takes almost 20mins to get my first dish like wow....",1
174,Great place for late night food. The oysters were very fresh and the sung ga rang muoi was also good. Big area with a kit of customers. Service is decent and they serve beer as well till late . Normally gets busy around 1 am when all the bars close.,4
174,I think even a single star was generous because this place had decent food but terrible service. It was a complete mess and made me order water 5 times before they were even able to get me my water. They were all out confused and even paying the bill was a pain and for such a huge sum of money I believe you could eat at a way better spot. This would only be recommended if you want a place to waste money.,1
174,The service was pretty bad for a place this expensive. The food was good but we couldn't even order rice. They couldn't understand us. And they brought it really really late.,2

174,"Đồ ăn nấu nướng rất ổn vừa miệng, ngồi ngoài hoặc trong phòng nếu muốn sự yên tĩnh và riêng tư cho nhiều người, phục vụ các bạn nữ ok ăn mặc lịch sự mặc dù có hơi thiếu chuyên nghiệp, chủ yếu các món hải sản tôm hùm, cua biển, ốc các loại, ngoài ra cũng có một ít những món ngoài hải sản, nên gọi người quản lý tư vấn để ăn uống sao cho phù hợp chi phí vì menu cũng không trình bày gì nhiều chủ yếu là giá cả các loại hải sản, có giàn âm thanh nhỏ nghe nhạc và ca hát có tính phí",5
174,"Là 1 trong những chuỗi của hàng ăn, uống, nhậu,... có tiếng tại Sài Gòn.
Tới quán việc đầu tiên thấy là nhân viên rất nhiệt tình, gần như là không có sự chậm trễ hoặc thiếu nhiệt tình nào ở đây cả. Lúc nào cũng có nhân viên phục vụ ở gần khu vực của khách hàng và đáp ứng yêu cầu của bạn
Đồ ăn ở đây rất tươi và ngon (không quá đắt), nếu mà để so sánh thì bạn sẽ tìm được rất nhiều hải sản chất lượng 5 sao ở nơi có chi phí rẻ hơn nhiều với khách sạn hay resort. So với các nhà hàng bình dân khác thì giá đồ ăn ở đây cao hơn khoảng 10-20%
Không gian, mặt đường thoảng mát, phù hợp cho những bữa ăn từ vài người cho tới 30-40 người. Rất ổn",4

Món tôm nướng có 2 con bị bở, k tươi nhưng khi mình báo thì nhân viên phục vụ lơ đi và cũng không giải thích gì thêm. Tôm giá cao nhưng k được như mong đợi của mình!

175,"I have been in this restaurant 2 times because my relative has taken me there. Characteristic of this restautant is that they have an audience Karaoke, but they only have Vietnamese singers, do not find Chinese or English singers. There is a local culture that I didn't realize at the beginning was that you put a tip in a rose and give it to those who sang, but the singer was not supposed to keep the tip. Tips are intended for those who work to find melody or those who play instruments :-O Fun but noise for those who can stand it.

We come from Brussels and we know this restaurant at the time that it is still located in Saigon Square and I must admit that we are very very disappointed with the quality of the service offered which is very far from its reputation as one of the best restaurants in Saigon. The welcome at the reception entrance is very poor, not to say 0. we are seated on the terrace and we have ordered 5 dishes for 2 people. you have to think about providing cold beers in the fridge. 1 st dish after 30 m alone. Then after 30 m we ask where are the next dishes and the young waitress without experience warmly announces to us that 2 dishes out of 5 ordered no longer exist. We receive our 2 nd dish after 1 hour and without more. And finally after insisting with the manager the 3rd main course arrives after 1h30 of waiting so we are disappointed and ask for the bill to leave. Very bad experience.

177,"This Japanese restaurant has great prices but a rather unusual menu. Everything is deep fried, it seems, and although the tables have bbq plates there are no bbq options available. The udon also strangely had no meat and curry powder in some of the toppings (my dining partner doesn’t like curry seasoning; I thought it was pretty good). The fish sandwich was tasty, but with unripe tomatoes, and the potato croquettes were also decently good. everything was fresh and hot.",4

Thịt nướng ngon. Có tráng miệng kem, sữa chua và nước lọc. Quán nhỏ trong hẻm yên tĩnh, ít nhân viên, nhưng anh chủ rất quan tâm đến khách. Là nơi vừa ăn trưa vừa thư giãn khá tốt.",5
177,"Nhà hàng có thể gọi món hoặc ăn buffet.
Ai ăn khoẻ nên chọn buffet ăn cho đã nha, mình ăn buffet lẩu và nướng luôn. Đồ ăn ngon, giá phải chăng. Thịt chất lượng lắm mọi người ạ. Menu có 4 loại lẩu, đã thử 3 loại thì mình thích Sukiyaki và Shabu shabu.

Đặc biệt thích udon xào, bánh mochi mặn (chưa thấy ở đâu có món này).
Kem luôn có 2 vị cà phê và trà xanh, có ya ua nữa.

Nên đặt bàn để đảm bảo có chỗ ngồi vì quán hơi ít bàn.",5
177,"Là khách hàng của quán nhiều năm và giới thiệu rất nhiều người về quán.
Quán ăn kiểu gia đình và chất lượng đồ ăn ngon, trau chuốt.
Tuy nhiên có 1 vấn đề về quán trong rất nhiều năm qua tôi sử dụng dịch vụ tại quán là thái độ phục vụ của nhân viên.
Giá buffet là 350k, chất lượng đồ ăn rất ngon, rất đáng tiền. Nhưng khi khách sử dụng hết đồ ăn và gọi thêm thì thường nhân viên chưa nghe hết câu đã quay ngoắt đi, hoặc là ko thèm nghe, nhận order sót, thái độ không vui vẻ. Đồ ăn order thêm thường đợi rất lâu hoặc là không lên đủ, lên chưa đủ đã xin dẹp than và lên lẩu.
Làm dịch vụ buffet thì có khách ăn ít có khách ăn nhiều, không thể nào khách muốn gọi thêm đồ ăn khi đã ăn hết món rồi thì nhận thái độ từ nhân viên.
Nếu sợ khách ăn nhiều thì chủ quán nên lên giá buffet hoặc để 350k chỉ cho 1 set ăn bao nhiêu đó món không đc kêu thêm. Đã gọi là buffet thì phải để khách ăn thoải mái.
Vấn đề này không phải mới đây đã nhiều năm tuy nhiên lần này tôi phải viết review mong chủ quán khắc phục.",3
177,"Đồ ăn của quán thực sự rất chất lượng, bò dày và nướng lên chấm rất ngon. Các bạn phục vụ rất chu đáo. Không gian ấm cúng, nhẹ nhàng, nằm trong một con hẻm nhỏ nên rất yên tĩnh. Đồ ăn trong set buffet không có món gì để chê đặc biệt là món thịt nhúng lẩu. Các bạn nên thử hết các món.
Tuy nhiên, quán nên thêm các loại nước chấm khi ăn cùng để đa dạng hơn và địa chỉ trên map là 171/16 nhé mọi người.",5
177,"Quán phục vụ các món ăn phong cách Nhật với 2 hình thức gọi món (a la carte) và buffet nướng. Buffet thịt nướng gồm heo bò gà và sườn cừu. Bò ra miếng nào là đáng miếng đó, thịt cắt dày và bản to chứ không phải kiểu ba chỉ cuộn mỏng như giấy. Sườn cừu nguyên cây hẳn hoi. Ngoài ra các món phụ cũng rất ngon, đặc biệt món cua sốt phô mai là cực phẩm must try của tiệm nha.

Nướng chán chê thì mình lên lẩu lòng bò motsunabe, sau cùng tráng miệng với kem cà phê và sữa chua nhà làm.

Nước nôi thế nào? Quán cho sẵn bình nước lọc uống miễn phí, nếu thích có thể order nước ngọt, chỉ 20k.

Quán nằm sâu trong con hẻm của đường Cô Bắc, tuy khu sầm uất nhưng quán lại khá vắng khách, có lẽ do ít người biết tới. Mức giá buffet ở đây theo mình là quá tốt so với chất lượng.

Nếu đang ngán ngẩm với mấy chuỗi buffet công nghiệp, Hương Vị Nhật sẽ giúp bạn định nghĩa lại trải nghiệm ăn buffet bbq.",5

177,"Lần đầu đi ăn mà Mình cảm thấy áp lực như vậy.
Chủ quán nói là ăn theo set, hết set thì được gọi thêm tùy ý. Nhưng:
Thứ 1: khi lên món để đồ ăn ở bàn sau mình và bàn khác lấy món. Ok cái này thì không trách được. Mình gọi thêm thì cực kỳ lâu và ko được phục vụ.
Thứ 2: theo set thì bàn đã ăn đủ set (đã bao gồm miếng nhiều mỡ). Lần 1 gọi Cho Em miếng bò tảng thì nhận được câu trả lời Em hạn chế bò tảng. Trong khi bàn mình chưa gọi thêm 1 món nào. Lần 2 lấy đủ dũng khí gọi cho Em 1 sườn và 1 dẻ sườn thì từ đâu Chị Chủ đưa ra 1 miếng mỡ y chang miếng hồi đầu ăn và nói phải ăn hết set không thì gọi thêm sẽ tính tiền (miếng này bàn mình đã ăn).
Lần đầu đi ăn mà phải nhìn thái độ Chị Chủ quán xem Chị có vui hay không.
Sợ tới mức mà không dám gọi thêm món hay rau sống.
Tự nhủ thôi thì đi ăn Chủ quán cho ăn gì phải ăn đó và ăn bao nhiêu là chủ quán quyết định.
Chắc chắn sẽ không có lần sau.",2

178,"This is one of the most famous wedding restaurants in HCMC. They offer lots of wedding combos and discounts. If you test each dish from the combos, it is delicious. But when it comes to the wedding night, the dishes from that same combo arent really in the similar impression. Especially the red wine beef stew, it is a nightmare to me. The taste of sauce and vegetables is good, but the meat is not fork-tender. It is as chewy as rubber and completely dry.
In general, this is still a beautiful and affordable place for a wedding night for young couples 💏. Just need to put some effort into the food.",4
