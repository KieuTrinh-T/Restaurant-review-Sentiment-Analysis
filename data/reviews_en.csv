1.1,5,"It is such a nice and romantic restaurant for new couples and family getting back the sweet memories.
Food is so nice with western courses. Drinks are interesting to enjoy. We had a very nice dinner with our boss and colleagues. Thank you for nice preparation as well.",en
1.2,4,"Food is marvelous.
We ordered the French onion soup which is my favourite, good as expected.
The pear salad my friend loved it very much.
The beef is good but the lamp rack is excellent, so tender and delivious, so I took more photo of it.
There are three things that worth comment, the restaurants seems too much emphasis on romantic place for meals, it seems awkward if you are not a couple.
The second thing is that we visited there for lunch , it was very quiet and the waiters seems not yet woke up for customers. We were actually the only people there for the period. And the waiter there seemed very curious why there were people coming for lunch.
The last thing is very disgusting, I have taken a photo but deccided not to post. The washrom was very dirty and the wash basin left with some ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
I like the food but I am not sure I should go back again. May be dinner but absolutely not lunch.
And please clean the toilet before you open for business.",en
1.3,5,One of those fine dining experience I have in my life.  Everything I ordered were incredibly tasty.  I dont have enough vocabulary to describe.  Just try it and I think you will love it.,en

1.6,5,A small yet very interesting European fusion themed restaurant tucked away in District 1 just over the plaza from the hotel street. The menu is both comprehensive yet in no way compromises on either presentation or quality as each dish was fantastic quality. The owner was also quite involved with the desserts especially and was more than happy to explain how each one was made and presented which gave a nice personal touch. By local standards however this place can get pricey but for something different yet great I would easily recommend this place.,en
1.7,5,"We really wanted to eat beef steak.  In the next steakhouse, the price went for 2 million dong for 200g.  And at the little door, the price is 4 times cheaper.  The steak is simply divine, the coffee is delicious, the desserts too.  Remained extremely satisfied.  We‚Äôll come here many more times.  the service is top notch.  even for the sake of such hospitality",en
1.8,5,"Went there for lunch and had a very nice time enjoying fine and sophisticated cuisine. Chef is quite inventive and doesn't hesitate to mix ingredients, recipes and cultures. Staff was very nice and supportive, even helped us with the kid so we can enjoy our dish!",en
1.9,4,"Nice cafe with good spaghetti.

Love the truffle mushroom (with veg option). Is a pricey one (VND350K) but is worth it. Personally does not like the overpowering black pepper taste that covered the truffle taste.

Does not like the pizza as it is not thin crust.

Hope to try other dishes next time.",en
1.10,5,"The place is quite romantic, suitable for couples and small families. In the evening, they light up candles and put roses (plastic) on all the tables regardless of whether you book in advance or not. They also have combo for decorations/ anniversary cakes. They mainly serve fusion food but it's ok just to order cakes and teas (combo available too). The price is ok, around 40,000 ~ 80,000/ piece of cake. Taste a little sweeter than I thought but everything was fine. I like the vibe here. The staff was very kind, he even spoke so softly that sometimes I could hardly hear what he was saying ü§£ 10% VAT and 5% service charge.
Parking next to Saigon Centre (with fee).",en
1.11,5,"I had an afternoon tea with rum raisin ice cream. The rum raisin in the ice cream was so flavourful and perfectly went along with the home made ice cream.
I knew that they are famous as a place to celebrate our anniversaries but actually didn't know that the deal is available at around 1 mil dong. It's literally a no-brainer given their excellent food quality and ambience. Besides the anniversary celebration, they apparently have good deals on Monday and Tuesdays. So I will definitely come back for a feast.",en

Good location, only few minutes walking from Bitexco and Takashimaya.
The staff is very friendly and well services.
Will come back, definitely.",en

1.14,5,The food here was fantastic and I had a great experience. üëçüëçI would personally like to thank Mr Tri Bao for serving us tonight. To anyone coming to this restaurant please ask for Mr Tri Bao because he provides excellent service and is very nice and helpful. I think this man needs a raise and should be promoted.

1.21,3,"Venue and decoration are very nice. Ideal for taking pictures. They actually decorate the table according to birthday or anniversary, nice touch.

However the food is very average.
- bread (free) is dry and tastes like 1 day old.
- lots of choices with truffle, we chose the salmon tartare, pasta with chicken, ravioli, but none of them taste truffle, but rather heavy garlic.
- beef wellington was ok.",en
1.22,3,"Food is so so , it's a place to take fancy photos with fancy decor. Expected much more quality food for the price. Typical place in Vietnam that focuses on looks rather than quality.  Waiter work very quick though.",en
1.23,5,"The place is absolutely gorgeous, the Milano pasta was perfectly cooked, and the staffs are friendly. Highly recommended",en
1.24,1,"Planned to celebrate my fiance birthday, so we went to inspect the restaurant. The restaurant looks nice, so we wanted to reserve the particular table for next weekday. However, we were told that we can reserve but they can not guarantee the table. Because the table is for 4 persons, not 2 persons. So, if they have 4 customers need the table, we have to move to smaller table. What the hack ?!?!? What is the point of booking !?!? It is like they try to fish 2 fishes but only have one bait! So, we felt disgusting and walked away. I will ensure my family and friend not going to this restaurant. Thumb down üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª",en

1.30,1,"Ah yes, this place. We ordered two appetizers, two entrees and two drinks. The appetizers went first then the two drinks. My friend then noticed three bugs on the one of the drinks and we proceed to returned it. Manager then made some excuses whether they checked it, blah blah,... Well, we just want to returned the two entrees, had the check and leave. Lo and behold, they only took out the one drink that had the bugs and we couldn't cancel the two entrees, even though the entrees weren't served yet. All and all, very disappointed. Seems like all the money go to the nice decor and other things and not the standard.",en
1.31,5,"Great discovery! The Little Door is literally,  a cute little door next to a massage place. Place is very cozy and well attended. Had the clam chowder and spaghetti a la bolognese.  You can tell everything is homemade, including the dinner rolls which can accompanied by truffle butter...bonus! I understood from the owner that they're also a bakery. Portions are European standard, great for a light but very tasty lunch. I cant wait to return for dinner. The pizza in the menu looked really good.",en
1.32,5,"Atmosphere was great, portion was more than acceptable and they had lovely violin playing which was the icing on the cake.",en
1.33,3,"Well presented and prepared  food. Service was good. If they want to attract the discerning clientele, then for goodness sake change the god awful music. Soft soap Christian  revival played in an endless loop is like torture for the soul. Heard the same bland soft-soul cover versions at least four times.  Maybe also take the lights down a bit. Too bright..",en
1.34,1,"Shocking- I am astounded at the high reviews!! The place is bloody incompetent. The picture of the salmon cake was massively deceptive. I reckon it was less than 50 grams!! 4-5 cm diameter and about 1cm thick - you would expect that it‚Äôs a free sample!! The duck breast was ample size but over cooked, tough & dry!
Ordering was a game of charades. There is nothing worse than have some illiterate boy bobbing his head as if he understands and worse popping in the occasional ok - it‚Äôs tantamount to lying and is just infuriating!! It took several tries to get him to go get someone that understands!!
This place is damn hopeless; do yourself a favor and avoid it",en

I had tried beef Wellington in some places in Vietnam but here, THE LITTLE DOOR made me so surprised.

The owner of the restaurant couldn't achieve his dream of opening a restaurant because he didn't have money, so he posted on Facebook and the people who saw the post invested $100 or $200 to collect money and open the restaurant with a small investment.

The inside is antique and the fat is high, so when the music resonates
Feel is very full.
A place worth visiting
You can drink coffee and drinks separately in the small outdoor garden, and the garden is small and pretty.

I went there after seeing the reviews that it was a Buncha restaurant.
We left our luggage at the airport and went on foot.
The distance is not far, but it took quite a while to get back because I couldn't find the right way.
When you walk in, most of them are locals. It is also a feature of the restaurant.
If you order Buncha, spring rolls are of course added!!
The sauce is delicious and the fresh vegetables are plentiful.

This, I've been told before hand, that it is part of a chain operated by the same group of people. First thing that comes to mind from experience was that chains are usually a hit or a miss.

My first impression upon entering was, clean and modern. Not a typical restaurant trying to mimic Vietnamese feel...and such was the case here. I felt  like it was fusion. Nonetheless, I liked it.

I thought the service was great. We had 2 staff members waiting nearby and a main lead that took all orders and serving dishes with the help of the other 2. They were attentive and not a moment our drinks were not attended to or an empty dish Sat idled. More importantly, they had smiles on their face. I had no complaints.

The presentation was nice, and as I had thought at first impression, it was fusion style. Which I didn't mind it at all. In fact, if was a nice twist with traditional ingredient.

The quality was really good but unfortunately it was not consistent throughout to warrant a 5 star. For instance, while the pan seared fish was tasty, the scallop were over cooked and visually dried. However, in general the dishes were good.

This place typical in pricing for a district 1 restaurant. It may be average to descent to foreigners, but definitely expensive for the locals.

Overall, I liked this restaurant and I can see myself coming back again.

4 stars!!!!",en

50.6,4,"Hard to believe that this place has existed since 1995 and I've only managed to come here for the first time a couple of years ago. 20 odd years ago, a Central European style Brauhaus must have been something incredibly exotic in Saigon, in the 2020s it seems rather old fashioned in a city full of trendy craft beer breweries.
The interior design is spot on, you really do feel like stepping into something that might as well be in Prague or Bratislava. A proper traditional pivnica. Apart from imported legit Pilsner Urquell that obviously comes at a price, they only brew two kinds of lager here, Pilsner style light and dark, of good quality. Again, this must have been something really special even a decade ago, but it seems quaint nowadays. Prices for beer are still very reasonable at 60k for a big glass. The food, however, mostly Vietnamese with a few porky Euro dishes thrown in, is overpriced. Quality is good and portions generous, but count on spending around 1 mil here for a table of 4.
Service is not terribly friendly either, but then that's authentic, too.

We expected Asian fusion and a good amount of flavour. I‚Äôve eaten at many restaurants, cheap and expensive. We got the most expensive set menu. Here, the food was cooked very well but often lacked seasoning. I appreciate sometimes flavours are delicate but this was bordering on bland. We had to ask for salt and pepper (none on the table) with the steak dish and to he honest it brought all the components to life and tasted delicious. It was a shame I had already eaten half of it before I asked.

Overall we had fun, but we didn‚Äôt get many Asian flavours and it felt like a restaurant with an identity crisis. It didn‚Äôt have the rich flavours of, of example, French cuisine or the spices of Vietnamese food. We left feeling we could have got something less refined, but much tastier for half the cost.",en

(Almost) all the team is made of deaf and hearing impaired people. Therefore, communication must be made through the signal language.

On the table, there is a simple and essential guide book to allow you to get a basic conversation with the staff.
Of course, it is not easy at all but a try is worth and, I think, also highly appreciated by the guys who work here.

Being a polyglot, I loved the idea (is not the signal language a foreign language as any other ? ) and, even more, the chance that the two owners gave to these guys who, as anybody else, try to make their jobs at their best.

What about the food ? Delicious but expect small portions and European prices.

It has been an incredible overall experience. Thanks so much, Blanc.",en

61.16,5,"So this was my very first trip to Vietnam and usually you wanna do all kinds of stuff and go somewhere new everyday. But this place (both blanc and noir) completely blew my mind and made this journey even more special. First time we visited blanc we (my brother and I) had no reservation but the staff welcomed us very warm-heartedly. The whole evening they were perfectly attentious and the food was just to die for. Don't expect streetfood, this is real cuisine!
About a week later we decided to bring our mother, a born vietnamese and vegetarian. She was not only enjoying the food but was also very touched by the humanistic concept of the restaurant and the wonderful people that work here. When she found out that there was noir downstairs she immediately wanted to go. So we made a reservation for the next day.
Dinner in the dark (lunch actually) was very well organized and executed. The vegetarian menu option was exquisite and quite divers (which is actually hard to find because a lot of other places have very little options for vegetarians). We had a lot of fun this noon and felt perfectly comfortable thanks to the perfect service!
So all in all, I cannot recommend blanc and noir enough! This experience will always have a special place in my heart and I'll always remember it with a smile!",en

Probably want to go for trendy cuisine. The presentation is okay but the taste is ordinary.

61.70,4,"A restaurant where you can eat Vietnamese fusion at an affordable price. Located on the 2nd floor of Noir.
This restaurant is staffed by deaf people, and orders are taken using sign language. There is no problem because there is a polite guideline and follow-up, and I can spend a very enjoyable time because I will teach you with a smile. There are not so many menus, so you can choose from 2 types of soup, 2 types of salad, and 4 types of main dishes. There is also a course, but this time it is a la carte. Ordered chicken salad and vegan curry. Every plate is beautifully arranged and worth seeing. It seems to be Vietnam that edible flowers are on. You can share a pot of tea, and it's very smart to add hot water naturally.
Like Noir, I think Ho Chi Minh's charm is that there are such concept restaurants!",en
61.71,5,"I used the website to make an appointment, and I already wanted a set meal for the final exam. Lunch was noir.dining in the dark downstairs. It was a very shocking meal. The sign language restaurant for dinner still did not disappoint: pea cold soup, chicken salad, Angus black Beef and black sesame sorbet. It is also a fusion dish. When you are seated, the clerk will roughly explain the basic sign language, and then carefully read the sign language used for meals such as meat and vegetables (because you must communicate with the hearing-impaired clerk, it can only be used in Ho Chi Minh City), the overall is delicate and delicious. I think I should have ordered medium rare. The clerk said that there are only 10 restaurants like this (hearing-impaired clerks) in the world, and it is difficult for hearing-impaired people to find a job. The restaurant spent two years training the clerks.
In addition to the good quality of meals, such a restaurant is also very important for them to integrate into the society and make money with their own strength, and build their confidence and sense of accomplishment. I deeply feel that Taiwan should also have such an institution or restaurant. The brand‚Äôs Wuguang restaurant lunch and sign language dinner really let me learn a lot. By the way, next week the brand will have a hearing-impaired massage parlor (not sure if it‚Äôs the hearing-impaired or visually-impaired, I couldn‚Äôt hear clearly after eating too much earbags) opening.",en

That said, I only had the barbecue pulled pork pizza which I found the sauce to be a little too sweet. Vegetables with good though. The staff took care to follow instructions to have no onion and less garlic without stirfry vegetables. Happy to see a good selection of craft beers on the menu. If I had the opportunity to try other dishes on the menu, maybe I would would score higher. I can‚Äôt forget to mention that I was well surprised to see the ++ on the bill.

The staff members spent more time socializing at their own table than serving customers.  There was a table across the way with three other staff members (the same that took our order) drinking beer and having fun while we struggled to get some aassistance..

As for the food, we ordered bbq pork tips, which would be more accurately described as steamed pork with cheap BBQ sauce slathered on it. It had zero grill flavor.  Really disappointing.  We also ordered something called ""mexican quesodilla"" despite having very little cheese in it. And for the four segments we got which were quite small) it came with one tiny dish overly sweet (clearly canned) salsa.  Hardly enough for eating with one slice of quesadilla much less all four.

Additionally we had grilled fish (red snapper) that came out lukewarm and soggy rather than hot and crispy. The flavor was good but they let it sit around far too long before bringing it out to us.

Honestly the only thing we felt was up to the standards i am used to was the fried potato wedges. They were crispy and hot. Unfortunately they weren't paired with an accompanying sauce other than the Mayonnaise and ketchup we already had at our table.

We parked and entered over a small bridge shaded by a huge mango tree full of fruit. We were welcomed straight to a table along a thematic wall of hand painted white lotus. The restaurant has been recently remodeled. Downstairs is for dining while upstairs is all about tea and zen.
The menu offers a wide variety of delicious and health conscious starters and main courses that non vegetarians will enjoy. My friend did all the ordering so I‚Äôm not sure what each plate was called. All were exquisite, light and delicious. S√∫p h·∫ßu th·ªß was my favorite dish. The mushrooms in this soup are very special. Make sure to try the longan fruit with lotus seed for desert.

Everything we ate was fresh and delicious. The chefs use the best quality ingredients to produce dishes that are simply delightful. The restaurant also offers a wonderful drink menu, and they offer one of the best tea selections in the region. The teas are surely worth sampling.
The service was great. It seemed to me that the waiters were engaged and interested in their jobs. The owner seemed very warm and cultured.
I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is serene.
If you like Hum‚Ä¶ this place is worth visiting and not so expensive.",en

We ended up paying double. It feels unfair and a complete rip off. NEVER AGAIN!!",en
84.5,1,I think this restaurant is over rated. They seemed to be in a hurry and not really focused on the customers.

Not worth the visit.,en

I am a long time vegan, and have lived in HCMC and other places in the country for years.
I thought I've seen it all, but here they surprised me with a bite-sized portion of fresh rolls (costing 90k!),
And a noodle dish that looked and tasted like it was cooked by a kid.

The atmosphere and decoration is good, so if you just come here for a drink and sit with people / with your laptop,
it might be acceptable.
But don't order any food, there are hundreds of cheaper and better restaurants around.

I don't believe any of those past reviews with high ratings, there's something fishy about it.",en
84.9,1,"Pretentious. Bad service, waiters were only focused on one group, while ignoring others.
I guess this was once a well run restaurant that has changed owners or staff.
Food is Okay, but nothing special compared to other restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City. Small portions. Definitely don't order the sushi, and don't be misled by the pictures in the menu.
There are many other restaurants that offer better value, so it's not worh the the detour.

No idea where those 5 star ratings come from.",en

89.2,1,"Reasonable price for K BBQ, meat isn‚Äôt that great but it‚Äôs doable considering this is one of the less crowded restaurants in the area.

However, the real issue is the staff. I was triple charged after eating here. I immediately called the restaurant to ask them to check if they received the funds (per instructions from my bank). The girl answering the phone didn‚Äôt even bother to check, but told me straight away that ‚Äúoh we didn‚Äôt triple charge you?‚Äù Whereas I saw them swiped my card multiple times because the machine ran out of paper, but they only gave me one receipt to sign. I called them a few more times after waiting for a few weeks, that I didn‚Äôt receive my refund but the staff insisted that they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.

Long story short, had to wait 90 days (over Tet holidays) for my bank to file a dispute with Visa and I finally won. No matter how good the food is, we won‚Äôt be back. There are so many things could‚Äôve been done to avoid all this (told me straight away BEFORE you swipe my cards 2 more times, put me on hold while you check with your bank if the funds went through, following ups, etc.) but all radio silence from the owner/ restaurant altogether.",en

Here we come again! It's dinner.
Hi, Chai seems to be the authentic taste.

201906
It was real Indian curry.
Rather south.
An Indian said it, so there is no doubt.",en
96.151,3,"The main customer base is staff at the nearby airport and Indians living nearby. Like an Indian restaurant, there are a lot of menu items, but if you look at the pictures and English descriptions, it seems like the food, and the curry can get confused like the curry. There is a set menu, but this is not recommended. The amount used by the Korean army 20 years ago was not autonomously served on the food tray, but served as a feeling of being forced to serve a small amount under the excuse of lack of supply. For the set menu, curry can be selected from lamb/chicken/seafood. On future visits, I plan to ignore the set and try again as a single item. It looks like there are two Indian chefs in the kitchen. The mutton curry's lamb was softer than I thought, and the curry was also soft ^^;;;; When ordering a set, 2 pieces of large Plain Naan are served along with Steamed Rice. I can't eat rice after eating this. There was a lot of naan, but I dipped it in the curry, so I didn't have enough curry to mix with rice. Hen. The tandoori chicken served on the plate was softer than expected, but the taste was too light. Lassi was delicious. The photo at the end of the photo is a picture of a food plate that will evoke nostalgia for those who have passed away.",en

What disappointed me was the availability of dishes, there aint much to order for dim sum and the portion of roast-meat-dishes is much less for the double price you pay. It's not bad, but I can definitely and easily find better options.",en
97.3,4,"Located on the second floor of the Tan Son Nhat hotel, this Dim Tu Tac location can get quite packed. Service is good and tables are turned fairly quickly compared to other locations. However, the food quality is not as good as the Hoang Van Thu location near the Sheraton. The food is good, but it can be better. We were seated promptly but the wait on the food can get slow in between dishes. Overall, good service and good food",en
97.4,1,"It's honestly baffling to me that this restaurant has received such positive reviews with such basic comments like ""good"" or ""delicious."" Don't be fooled by these seemingly glowing reviews - they couldn't be further from the truth.

First off, the restaurant is located in a shabby, rundown 3-star hotel, and the decor is outdated and unappealing. The restroom is downright filthy and unsanitary, so if you're looking for a clean dining experience, this is not the place for you.

Even worse than the lackluster atmosphere is the quality of the food. Despite the exorbitant prices, the portions are minuscule and definitely not worth what they charge. I mean, the prices are on par with what you'd expect in the US, which is ridiculous considering the subpar quality.

Now let's get to the actual food. The jasmine tea is disgustingly watered down and tastes like hot boiled water instead of tea. And don't even get me started on the dim sum. We ordered Har Kau, and the skin is so thick and flavorless that it might as well not even be there. And the fried noodles with seafood? Not only were they cold, but they were dripping with oil. When we asked the server why they were cold, they completely ignored us, which just adds insult to injury.

Save yourself the money and skip this forgettable place altogether. If you're looking for authentic and delicious dim sum, look elsewhere. Trust me, you'll thank me later.",en

It was really cheap and not comparable to touristic prices. So if you are looking for a cheap diner you can go for it.

They serve so slow. After they forced me to order some extra options, which bring their more income. Then they delivered me the meals without those. But when they collect the cost, they still put on the bill all the extra optipns.
Other bad thing that they put extra charge for tax without notices.
The most thing was made me disappointed that the staff didn't give me the bill, the made me doubt that the staff took me higher cost than the bill shows. Means the staff stole some money from the guest.

I think I just come back there again when there are only 3 restaurants on our planet.",en

We ordered kids meals, noodles, and pho with 1 drink. The flavour was mediocre at best. Not worth the prices. My son accidentally spilled some soup and I asked the staff for napkins...they said they didn‚Äôt have any... interestingly they said we could is the ones that were left at the table, the wet ones that they charge you extra for without telling people or first time travellers.  The sad part was they had the odacity to include a tip on to the bill. We ate as fast as our children‚Äôs sped would allow and left.

The food is delicious, the fish is fresh. In general, I recommend everyone to go and try it for yourself!",en

I'm in my mid-40s and I'm an employee, but I'm having a hard time.. They gave me food late.. I waited for an hour while eating. I said something later, I'm sorry. I'm so pour.

They sell some of the ingredients that they use in their menu, you can see at the entrance to buy. I forgot to take a pic of the hot pot at the end.

140.7,3,"Their name have a phrase about being specialized in good food of Nha Trang. This place may provide different flavor for tourist but not for me.
I have been to Nha Trang so many times and eat at so many places and other provinces in the central part of Vietnam but the flavor there somehow is different and more tasty.
The weak point here is the sauces, so salty. In Vietnam Cuisine, your sauces fail so your dishes is not good overall .
The price are expensive compared with the quantity and the quality of foods. There are some dishes that are so normal and I forget to take picture of them.
The atmosphere is not something special here. It looks clean and that‚Äôs all. The staff is ok.
I myself do not think this place can be a good place to give you good food of Nha Trang. There are a lot of good places for you to eat with more original flavor and super delicious sauces.",en

140.10,2,"I came here as it was recommended by our hotel, but I had a really disappointing experience here.

I am a pescatarian and ordered the Banh Xeo with prawn and squid and specifically asked the waitress if it had any meat other than prawns. I was informed it hadn‚Äôt.

Upon it arriving at the table I noticed that there was some pork in when I had eaten one of the pancakes already (there was no squid). When I told the waitress she shrugged and didn‚Äôt really say much else. Considering a lot of people (including close friends and family) don‚Äôt eat pork for religious reasons, it was completely unacceptable to not be informed of the fact it had meat in.

When I told the staff I wasn‚Äôt happy about this before leaving, they didn‚Äôt take responsibility for this.

The squids also had no taste at all.

Our orders were:
1. C∆°m ng√≥ sen
2. ƒê·∫≠u h≈© n·∫•m g√≥i gi·∫•y b·∫°c. (Note: they use egg tofu)
3. Rau lang x√†o t·ªèi
4. Canh n·∫•m m√≥i ki·ªÉu Th√°i
Some bottles of water

#1 & 2 are pretty darn good üëç, not overly season light on salt, #3 is good too simple enough as if I can cook it myself lol. #4 a bit disappointed in terms of both quality and quantity, n·∫•m m√≥i aka termite mushrooms aren't what my friend would describe and the taste of the soup didn't win our votes either

My friend says the quality of the food has gone down over the years, it was fantastic wheb they were first open some 5 years ago. Despite that, the food was pretty much on point

Our bill came out was a hair under 400k, which is really good considering the cool place that looks like a real restaurant in China without 3 hours of flight, 4 hours of traffic and 1 hours 30 minutes of wait time üòÇ.

The service was very good though! Our wait staff was kind, prompt and very accommodating to a large group.

Great service and ambience but other than that everything about the dining experience at HOME was a complete dissapointment. For the price point, the quality of food is completely abyssmal. Truthfully, it tasted like an amateur's first attempt at a dish. The table next to us was also visibly and audibly shocked at the standard of the courses.

On top of that, my girlfriend suffered from violent food poisoning immediately after our meal. She ended up vomiting up everything we ate.

I have no idea where such positive reviews come from but it's definitely unjustified.

144.70,4,"This new, international-level restaurant near the city center is a great place to have some drinks (cocktails are really good). The atmosphere is nice, and the service is just impeccable. But the food does not match the other qualities of the venue. Some dishes are westernized to strange result (like fried rice with vegetables, which turned to be something once can expect in a cheap European cafe). Pomelo salad was nicely served and tasty, though. Also, note, that the venue is usually full, so reservation would be a wise idea. Ah, yeh - the WC does not meet the restaurant level at all.",en

144.72,3,The staff is trying hard to get as good review as possible but should be more than that for five stars. The outdoor terrace siting could be more comfortable and the food in Vietnam is normaly of better taste. We were pushed to try a  fish which was far from tasty. Too expensive for what they offer.,en

First to confirm, this restaurant get good chef, main dishes are about 8-8.5/10. So these are reasons why I give such 3 stars:
1. Price is very high because comparing to its service. The waiter and waitress, as well as their manager, they were not smiling nor friendly, not at all. I worked in a 5 star service years ago, this is very not professional.
2. Secondly, about the soup, they made them like a joke for an expensive Chinese cuisine. I ordered 2 soups, both is very thick with corn starch. I worked in kitchen before, I am quite sure that both of the soup is the same, just differed from extra ingredients.

Perfect for a higher-end dining experience or to entertain visitors, without spending an exhorbitant amount. (Note: my cost estimate was per person; three people shared 5 dishes.)

They specialize in Vietnamese crepes with a variety of savory fillings - and a mushroom vegetarian option - (eaten with a generous amount of fresh greens and herbs); ingredients for fresh spring rolls with a tantalizing array of possibilities (platters of fresh greens, herbs, vegetables, rice vermicelli, rice paper and your choice of meat fill your table); meat or fish soups; and salads. Fried rice, stirfried greens, and some seafood dishes are also available. Fresh juice in a variety of combinations is also a feature.

The presentation is eye-catching and the flavors are well-balanced.

The greens and herbs were very clean and fresh (see photo of greens/herbs storage).

The restaurant has been renovated and redecorated, with seating upstairs, so there‚Äôs significantly more space than what you see when you first walk in.

The staff are prompt, friendly, attentive and patient.

A shout out to the security who watch your bikes: efficient, careful, attentive. They noticed I had dropped something (I didn‚Äôt realize it) and not only picked it up for me, but also took the initiative to request a small bag to replace my paper bag, which hadn‚Äôt survived the rain.

You will hardly find any place to seat during peak hours. So I will not recommend it for date or romantic dinner :D.

154.13,2,"Once again I was following great Google reviews and unfortunately I was disappointed. Firstly I perceived that as it was packed with Vietnamese it was a good sign and I was happy to choose this restaurant. But due to only Vietnamese guests and a fact the place is not on the 'foreigners' Saigon map', even though quite close to Bui Vien, the staff was obviously afraid to approach me as none of the waiters spoke English. It took them forever to take care of my order and I felt very uncomfortable as the waiters were always giggling when passing me as they were choosing who would have to take the longest straw and take care of me. Afterwards they also forgot to bring my drink and they served me with a ridiculously small amount of rice. Overall I was very disapointed. The meal was okay. But for the price approximately 70k for the Sechuan tofu I expected more when the restaurant wasn't on the main street and the service sucked.",en

159.89,4,"For Japanese people, the interior of the store is very stylish, and there are both terrace seats and inside seats, so I was very satisfied.
We went there around 9am on a Friday, but we were the only customers and it was a very quiet and relaxing time.
There was no cafe where you could have breakfast nearby, so this store, which is open 24 hours a day, was very nice.

The ceiling in the store was very high and there was a sense of freedom.

I had a lot of jackfruit.
Breakfast was 55 kvnd with food and drinks, and the cost performance was very good.
Rumba was cleaning the floor while eating and hit my feet.",en

The restaurant deco had a modern Vietnamese feel but not overpowering with history and colours. The food was great. The shared dishes portion were plenty for 2. We enjoyed the chicken fried rice in coconut (recommended) and clam dish. In fact, we enjoyed all the food except for the fried frogs which was a letdown. If you in the district 1 area and done with eating street food, then I would recommend a visit to Den Long.",en
162.2,5,"Had a great, reasonably priced meal here. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the decor was pretty. I ordered a soft shell crab, stir fried morning glory and caramelised pork dish with rice. The food was delicious and came very quickly. Would highly recommend for good Vietnamese food in a restaurant setting.",en
162.3,5,"The food is well-prepared and so delicious!  I ordered the baked fish,  which tastes marvelous!  The interior is beautiful but not cheasy.

162.5,5,"Coming from Singapore and into Saigon, we were absolutely blown away by the quality and service (us being foodies this is certainly not an overstatement). The menu had a great variety of dishes, reasonably priced (ard 100k per dish) and you get to dine in a clean and lovely decorated interior.

Staff were well-versed in conversational English and the food was served really promptly after ordering. They even gave us free desserts!

Thank you Den Long for the wonderful eating experience. We will definitely be back. (We had our dinners here two days in a row)",en
162.6,5,The food is served relatively fast and tastes wonderful! Service is really good!

Overall a not-very-good but not-too-bad dining experience.",en
162.9,4,"The food was superb as well as the service here. What was the most unique and delicious of the array of food I ordered was the Tonkin flower vegetable and the pomelo salad. A blend of sweet and spicy nature of the pomelo paired it greatly with the rice. The Tonkin flower, native to Vietnam, was a new and delicious taste. Everything else was superb as well and the service from the staff was great especially when the spring roll was slightly tough and they replaced them with a brand new replacement. Overall 9/10 would recommend for a traditional Vietnamese cuisine.",en
162.10,4,"Nice clean place at first visit but your experience will depend on where you sit because they have 4 floors and the atmosphere is very different between them (the ground floor is best). The aircon is also very dry and not at all good for your nose in one of the backrooms (3rd floor, room without windows).

The quality of food depends a lot on what you order. The stewed pork is excellent but the fried calamari is plain boring. However, they do have the best soy sauce in town. I could eat two bowls if rice with the sauce and a beer. I would also include a plate of morning glory, that stuff is delicious.

Service is relatively quick but obviously will depend on the number of other guests. People here are friendly. The Lost in Saigon cocktail is a total killer so be careful to drink it slowly.",en

The menu looked so good, we ordered 7 dishes to try as much as possible. And we were absolutely thrilled by the delicious variety! The sauces, the flavouring, the looks: all perfect. What made the evening even better was the extremely kind and friendly staff, who explained every dish and really welcomed us to the city. We will definitely come back üòä",en

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever had this experience at a restaurant. Make sure you make a reservation because this place is fully booked lately. We arrived last night but couldn‚Äôt come over so I have to wait until today. Highly recommend you guys should try all these Vietnamese traditional daily meals.",en

162.22,5,"Exceptionally good food, service, and warm ambience without breaking the bank.

Wife and I normally read reviews with a grain of salt, and therefore came with average expectations... and oh boy... were we blown away!

This won't be a lengthy review, but us coming  back for the second time (perhaps 3rd?) says alot about the food at Den Long, the founder Dave, (super friendly and even gave us gastro tips as to where to dine in Vung Tau, and also a brief history as to how DL came to be!) and the amazing service crew.

Also a special shout out to the budding accountant Long (I hope we got your name right!) Who told us about the HCM's war museum and with that lovely chat in general.

Brilliantly cooked food. Check! Super service. Check! Cosy and friendly ambience. Check! The Golden Buzzer from us. Check!

We will not hesitate to recommend this lovely eatery.

N.b. Not sure what that luscious, homemade green condiment that came with the grilled pork ribs and pomfret is called. But we love it. It's piquant, with a hint of lime and with the right balance of spiciness and sweetness.",en
162.23,3,"Very clean and friendly staff who speak pretty good English. This restaurant seems to be mainly for tourists. When I ate there, I did not see any locals. Although reasonably priced, food was not too impressive. I ordered a duck hot pot, which was quite overcooked. Since I cannot eat spicy food, I asked to make sure it does not have hot pepper in it. But it tasted very spicy, and I couldn't eat much. If you are looking for a dining experience similar to what you have at  a Vietnamese restaurant in Western cities, this place is perfect and the price is probably better.",en

We came last night with no reservation, and we just only waited for few minutes to get the table.

162.28,5,"Food pricing:
1. Glass Noodle With Crab Meat - 155,000 VND. I find it so cheap for this dish and there numerous chunks of crab meat in it.
2. Crunchy Vegetarian Rolls - 89,000 VND. Nice tofu fillings with crispy exterior, don't think you will be disappointed eating spring rolls in Vietnam.
3. Caramelised Pork - 89,000 VND. Can probably give this a miss as the sauce is passably tasty but the meat is rather tough.
4. Garlic Morning Glories - 89,000 VND. Super refreshing and crunchy. How come their vegetables are so tasty?
5. Sticky Rice with Banana and Coconut - 39,000 VND. Lusciously decadent.

All in all, we spent about S$31.00 on this meal. So happy with the pricing. And, the place is so beautiful",en

The summer roll was a nice size with chewy rice paper, good amount of local herbs inside. The pork was ok but the steak was something else. It was so tender and cooked in perfection, the sauce had a good kick to it and those on the steak (raw garlic, ginger and chilli I assume) were so tasty I could put some on the rice to eat.
Staffs were very friendly and helpful, spoke good English.
I‚Äôd happily go back next time I‚Äôm in Saigon.",en

Only the wrap is hard (I think because it was served first and we did not consume immediately as we waited all to come and take photos). Price is decent for a proper meal here + ambience here in HCMC.",en
162.34,5,"The food was super tasty, but the portions were a bit smaller than expected (taking into account the prices), at least for the catfish and coconut fried riceüòÖ it‚Äôs good we ordered a lot of things.

The pomfret was very good, but the sauce was super spicy, even if I ordered it just a bit spicy, so take care if you don‚Äôt eat spicy food. Other than that, the fish was very good.

The rice was also very good, a bit sweet from the coconut, but I didn‚Äôt particularly taste the chicken. Don‚Äôt take this as a main course though, it‚Äôs not that big, at least if you‚Äôre hungry.

The pomelo salad was super fresh and tasty. Had some pork pieces inside, super tasty all together.

The passion fruit mojito didn‚Äôt taste very passion fruity, but it was good.

Handwritten notes are always up my alley and these were jotted down so kindly by him. Love the idea of being able to write down well-wishes and hang them on a branch as well. I was too hungry for my usual food shots but everything was brilliant.

The food is just okay, delicately prepared and missing the touch of local street flavor (lacking a good char and having a muted flavor profile).

I get why the rating is high at this place - great service, clear english menu with description, good ambience - a very pleasant experience for tourists who miss such comfort/ luxury while travelling. :)",en

Started eating the crab curry which didn‚Äôt taste right. Queried and was then told they had made another mistake and given us frog curry. They took that away and we then had to wait quite a while for the crab curry so our other food was spoiling. When we got the crab curry, the flavour was nice but there just wasn‚Äôt much crab in it. We also didn‚Äôt get very much rice. Other silly things like cracked and chipped sauce pots on our food wasn‚Äôt particularly hygienic or safe.

The crab dongfeng is extremely delicious... We have not tasted any other Chinese restaurants coming close to it in the years we've been in HCM. Of course it comes with a price, depending on the crab's weight.

Try the black pepper beef. Not like other beef.. They cook it such that it still has chewyness and tenderness in it and with the spice of the black pepper, wow!

The jielan when we 1st saw it served, we were quite depressed as it was only just stalks.. But unlike other restaurants, they were soft and we ended up clearing the entire dish.

If you are into Chinese food, this is the place to go, but be willing to pay.

For non smokers, please let the staff know, else u will have clowns who will puff away in the air conditioned place.

Ordered chicken and vegetables, soup and for vegetables ordered some okra (lady fingers).
The chicken was completely flavorless and tough. The soup was so overly sour I couldn't even eat it. And the okra (which I was expecting to be healthy), was breaded and deep fried.  Bottom all the 3 dishes tasted horrible, and the bill was about $30 usd. They also included a 5% service charge however the service was pretty bad as well, all the staff seem to be rude or in a bad mood.  Never again!",en
165.50,1,"It‚Äôs been a couple years before I went back to the restaurant. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm so disappointed with the service and food here. We had a family meeting at the restaurant last week. Here are all we received from the restaurant:
1. Slow and neglected service: all servers were standing in the front and kept chatting to each other, they didn‚Äôt pay attention when we needed them. They also gave us an attitude when we asked them to refill hot water in teapot.
2. Ordering: I asked them to give me sometimes to review menu and discussed to my family, he, however kept standing next to us and rushing us to order. That way made me feel rushed and uncomfortable.
We ordered water bottles, they didn‚Äôt have enough, even though we only ordered 5.
We ordered beer bottles, they brought out cans saying they ran out of bottles. Fine.
3. The food was fairly ok, but it was overcharged in compared to the quality.
Beijing duck is the only nice dish in my opinion. Everything was fine until vegetable stir-fried noodles of my mom came out, half of the vegetables smell bad (the smell like when you store vegetables for too long and its getting mouldy) and taste sour. We spoke to supervisor, he insisted that was the way vegetables were. My mom told him to smell the vegetables, he said he would inspect the kitchen, but never came back till we were about to leave without a proper response.
4. Come to the bill: they charged us bottles instead of cans. It‚Äôs unbelievable. Not too much to pay, but the way they‚Äôre serving customers and stealing little money from them are not the way a fancy restaurant in heart of saigon should do.",en

165.52,3,"Recommend Beijing duck, chicken salad and dim sum. Broken tables are a disappointment. Staff can be more approachable. Open for 24 hours so the place gets even busier after 9 pm to cater for bar and restaurant staff who have finished their work but have nowhere else to go.",en
165.53,5,"I waited a long time before reviewing this restaurant, mainly because it is so busy. This is hands down my go-to spot for late-night food, dim sum breakfast, and Chinese seafood. The service here is on point.
They normally get busy around 11pm after the dinner rush because this is spot to hit after a night on the town. My friends and I have been here dozens of times. It has never let us down. From fresh juices to beer. Noodle bowls or fried rice. This is the spot.
I have so many pictures I will just post the most recent with this review. I highly recommend the banh cuon chien XO sauce. All the dim sum is on point. Soups, family style dinners... Fresh seafood! Just let me know if you like the food here. I'll invite you back for a feast!
Highly recommended. Will return many many times. A+++Xem th√™m",en

I went here with my someone and we ordered 4 dishes: a plate of fried rice, some stir-fried kailan with garlic, Kinh Do pork ribs & shrimp wrapped in tofu skin.

There are several upscale/casual places that serves the same cuisine with better quality and with half the prices: Va Th√†nh, Madam Oyster. Does not recommend and will not come back.",en
