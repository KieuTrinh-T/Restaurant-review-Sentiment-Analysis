50.16.3,50.16,The atmosphere is influenced by the culture of the Czech Republic and this branch s architecture is inspired by the strong image of the Pilsner Urquell beer brand,28,1,1
50.16.4,50.16,However the authentic cuisine and premium beer quality may contribute to the costs so brace your wallet,17,1,1

61.13.1,61.13,An amazing venture into the world of deaf and mute people,11,1,1
61.13.2,61.13,After a short introduction we were left with a sign language manual and our extremely friendly and helpful waiter Hui to order everything with our hands,26,1,1
61.13.3,61.13,It turned out to be a bit challenging so we shared many laughs and learned a lot but in the end we left feeling very connected and proud that we could add our bit to this amazing project,38,1,1

61.13.5,61.13,Overall something we will never forget thank you Blanc,9,0,1
61.14.1,61.14,Blanc is a restaurant with a new and unique concept even if less extreme than the one of his brother Noir Dining in the dark another top rated restaurant,29,1,1
61.14.2,61.14,Almost all the team is made of deaf and hearing impaired people,12,1,1
61.14.3,61.14,Therefore communication must be made through the signal language,9,1,1
61.14.4,61.14,On the table there is a simple and essential guide book to allow you to get a basic conversation with the staff,22,1,1
61.14.5,61.14,Of course it is not easy at all but a try is worth and I think also highly appreciated by the guys who work here,25,1,1
61.14.6,61.14,Being a polyglot I loved the idea is not the signal language a foreign language as any other and even more the chance that the two owners gave to these guys who as anybody else try to make their jobs at their best,43,1,1
61.14.7,61.14,What about the food Delicious but expect small portions and European prices,12,1,1

61.16.6,61.16,She was not only enjoying the food but was also very touched by the humanistic concept of the restaurant and the wonderful people that work here,26,1,1
61.16.7,61.16,When she found out that there was noir downstairs she immediately wanted to go,14,1,1
61.16.8,61.16,So we made a reservation for the next day,9,1,1
61.16.9,61.16,Dinner in the dark lunch actually was very well organized and executed,12,1,1
61.16.10,61.16,The vegetarian menu option was exquisite and quite divers which is actually hard to find because a lot of other places have very little options for vegetarians,27,0,1
61.16.11,61.16,We had a lot of fun this noon and felt perfectly comfortable thanks to the perfect service So all in all I cannot recommend blanc and noir enough This experience will always have a special place in my heart and I ll always remember it with a smile,48,1,1

61.66.1,61.66,Don t comment on the concept of the restaurant just talk about the food and price,16,1,1
61.66.2,61.66,not worth it Probably want to go for trendy cuisine,10,0,1
61.66.3,61.66,The presentation is okay but the taste is ordinary,9,1,1
61.66.4,61.66,The fish has a fishy smell and the meat is soft raw The chicken is not chewy when it is mashed so do not push it The best is the predinner bread dessert and my drink the first mocktail,38,1,1
61.7.6,61.7,A restaurant where you can eat Vietnamese fusion at an affordable price,12,1,1
61.7.7,61.7,Located on the 2nd floor of Noir,7,1,1
61.7.8,61.7,This restaurant is staffed by deaf people and orders are taken using sign language,14,1,1
61.7.9,61.7,There is no problem because there is a polite guideline and followup and I can spend a very enjoyable time because I will teach you with a smile,28,1,1
61.7.10,61.7,There are not so many menus so you can choose from 2 types of soup 2 types of salad and 4 types of main dishes,25,1,1
61.7.11,61.7,There is also a course but this time it is a la carte,13,1,1
61.7.12,61.7,Ordered chicken salad and vegan curry,6,1,0
61.7.13,61.7,Every plate is beautifully arranged and worth seeing,8,1,1
61.7.14,61.7,It seems to be Vietnam that edible flowers are on,10,1,1
61.7.15,61.7,You can share a pot of tea and it s very smart to add hot water naturally,17,1,1
61.7.16,61.7,Like Noir I think Ho Chi Minh s charm is that there are such concept restaurants,16,1,1
61.71.1,61.71,I used the website to make an appointment and I already wanted a set meal for the final exam,19,1,1
61.71.2,61.71,Lunch was noir,3,1,1
61.71.3,61.71,dining in the dark downstairs,5,1,0
61.71.4,61.71,It was a very shocking meal,6,0,0
61.71.5,61.71,The sign language restaurant for dinner still did not disappoint pea cold soup chicken salad Angus black Beef and black sesame sorbet,22,1,0
61.71.6,61.71,It is also a fusion dish,6,1,1
61.71.7,61.71,When you are seated the clerk will roughly explain the basic sign language and then carefully read the sign language used for meals such as meat and vegetables because you must communicate with the hearingimpaired clerk it can only be used in Ho Chi Minh City the overall is delicate and delicious,52,1,1
61.71.8,61.71,I think I should have ordered medium rare,8,1,1
61.71.9,61.71,The clerk said that there are only 10 restaurants like this hearingimpaired clerks in the world and it is difficult for hearingimpaired people to find a job,27,1,0
61.71.10,61.71,The restaurant spent two years training the clerks,8,1,0

63.75.6,63.75,We also ordered something called mexican quesodilla despite having very little cheese in it,14,1,0
63.75.7,63.75,And for the four segments we got which were quite small it came with one tiny dish overly sweet clearly canned salsa,22,1,1
63.75.8,63.75,Hardly enough for eating with one slice of quesadilla much less all four,13,1,0
63.75.9,63.75,Additionally we had grilled fish red snapper that came out lukewarm and soggy rather than hot and crispy,18,1,1
63.75.10,63.75,The flavor was good but they let it sit around far too long before bringing it out to us,19,1,1
63.75.11,63.75,Honestly the only thing we felt was up to the standards i am used to was the fried potato wedges,20,1,1
63.75.12,63.75,They were crispy and hot,5,1,1
63.75.13,63.75,Unfortunately they weren t paired with an accompanying sauce other than the Mayonnaise and ketchup we already had at our table,21,0,0

96.151.1,96.151,The main customer base is staff at the nearby airport and Indians living nearby,14,1,0
96.151.2,96.151,Like an Indian restaurant there are a lot of menu items but if you look at the pictures and English descriptions it seems like the food and the curry can get confused like the curry,35,1,0
96.151.3,96.151,There is a set menu but this is not recommended,10,0,1
96.151.4,96.151,The amount used by the Korean army 20 years ago was not autonomously served on the food tray but served as a feeling of being forced to serve a small amount under the excuse of lack of supply,38,0,0
96.151.5,96.151,For the set menu curry can be selected from lamb chicken seafood,12,1,0
96.151.6,96.151,On future visits I plan to ignore the set and try again as a single item,16,0,0
96.151.7,96.151,It looks like there are two Indian chefs in the kitchen,11,1,1
96.151.8,96.151,The mutton curry s lamb was softer than I thought and the curry was also soft ^^ When ordering a set 2 pieces of large Plain Naan are served along with Steamed Rice,33,1,1
96.151.9,96.151,I can t eat rice after eating this,8,1,1
96.151.10,96.151,There was a lot of naan but I dipped it in the curry so I didn t have enough curry to mix with rice,24,1,1
96.151.11,96.151,The tandoori chicken served on the plate was softer than expected but the taste was too light,17,1,0
96.151.12,96.151,Lassi was delicious,3,1,1
96.151.13,96.151,The photo at the end of the photo is a picture of a food plate that will evoke nostalgia for those who have passed away,25,1,1
96.157.1,96.157,The food is delicious The staff is friendly and courteous Very good English is spoken The restaurant is definitely worth a visit,22,1,1
96.159.1,96.159,Super nice staff who speak excellent English,7,1,1
96.159.2,96.159,About 10 minutes walk from the airport in HCMC,9,1,1

96.159.5,96.159,I felt comfortable and would come again,7,1,1
96.16.2,96.16,If you go to Dongdaemun Station on Line 1 there are many Nepalese and Indian restaurants,16,1,1

96.16.4,96.16,5 times more satisfied with Seoul,6,1,1
97.1.1,97.1,Chinese food is delicious,4,1,1
97.1.2,97.1,The specialty i think is Beijing roast duck,8,1,1
97.1.3,97.1,Crispy skin and little meat sliced in front of the customers by the cook,14,1,0
97.1.4,97.1,Nice restaurant for business family meetup,6,1,1
97.2.1,97.2,Fair to say that the food quality is average this is to compare with other restaurants of the same standards,20,1,1
97.2.2,97.2,The service is also just average,6,1,0
97.2.3,97.2,What disappointed me was the availability of dishes there aint much to order for dim sum and the portion of roastmeatdishes is much less for the double price you pay,30,0,0
97.2.4,97.2,It s not bad but I can definitely and easily find better options,13,1,1
97.3.1,97.3,Located on the second floor of the Tan Son Nhat hotel this Dim Tu Tac location can get quite packed,20,1,1
97.3.2,97.3,Service is good and tables are turned fairly quickly compared to other locations,13,1,1
97.3.3,97.3,However the food quality is not as good as the Hoang Van Thu location near the Sheraton,17,0,1
97.3.4,97.3,The food is good but it can be better,9,1,1
97.3.5,97.3,We were seated promptly but the wait on the food can get slow in between dishes,16,1,0
97.3.6,97.3,Overall good service and good food,6,1,1
97.4.1,97.4,It s honestly baffling to me that this restaurant has received such positive reviews with such basic comments like good or delicious,22,1,1
97.4.2,97.4,Don t be fooled by these seemingly glowing reviews they couldn t be further from the truth,17,0,1
97.4.3,97.4,First off the restaurant is located in a shabby rundown 3star hotel and the decor is outdated and unappealing,19,1,0
97.4.4,97.4,The restroom is downright filthy and unsanitary so if you re looking for a clean dining experience this is not the place for you,24,1,0
97.4.5,97.4,Even worse than the lackluster atmosphere is the quality of the food,12,0,0
97.4.6,97.4,Despite the exorbitant prices the portions are minuscule and definitely not worth what they charge,15,1,0
97.4.7,97.4,I mean the prices are on par with what you d expect in the US which is ridiculous considering the subpar quality,22,0,0
97.4.8,97.4,Now let s get to the actual food,8,1,1
97.4.9,97.4,The jasmine tea is disgustingly watered down and tastes like hot boiled water instead of tea,16,0,0
97.4.10,97.4,And don t even get me started on the dim sum,11,1,1
97.4.11,97.4,We ordered Har Kau and the skin is so thick and flavorless that it might as well not even be there,21,1,0
97.4.12,97.4,And the fried noodles with seafood Not only were they cold but they were dripping with oil,17,1,0
97.4.13,97.4,When we asked the server why they were cold they completely ignored us which just adds insult to injury,19,0,0
97.4.14,97.4,Save yourself the money and skip this forgettable place altogether,10,1,0

97.97.2,97.97,However it is good enough if you are near the airport and would like to have some quick bites,19,1,1
97.99.1,97.99,I ve visited two Dim Tu Tak places in Ho Chi Minh District 1 and I came to this branch because I wanted to eat Dim Sum one last time before going to the airport,35,1,1

97.104.7,97.104,My deepest impression is the free dessert platter at the end which is very different from the previous Chinese restaurants,20,1,1
97.104.8,97.104,My favorite is their lemon ice,6,1,1
97.108.1,97.108,Quite satisfactory the best is the shrimp dumpling others are of a certain standard but the disadvantage is that it is very noisy you can t enjoy the morning tea it may be the habit of drinking tea,38,1,1
97.115.1,97.115,When ordering we told us that there is no dim sum,11,0,0
97.115.2,97.115,After ordering the next guests come to eat but have dim sum,12,1,1

98.3.1,98.3,[General] It is more like a food chain and not really authentic,12,1,1
98.3.2,98.3,They server a lot local food like Pho,8,1,1
98.3.3,98.3,[Ambiente] The store offers about 50 seats at the ground floor,11,1,1
98.3.4,98.3,You have to order directly and the front office and pay afterwards,12,0,1
98.3.5,98.3,[Pricing] It was really cheap and not comparable to touristic prices,11,1,1
98.3.6,98.3,So if you are looking for a cheap diner you can go for it,14,1,1
98.3.7,98.3,Actually we did not have much time to look for an alternative place,13,1,1

98.5.6,98.5,Other bad thing that they put extra charge for tax without notices,12,0,0
98.5.7,98.5,The most thing was made me disappointed that the staff didn t give me the bill the made me doubt that the staff took me higher cost than the bill shows,31,0,1
98.5.8,98.5,Means the staff stole some money from the guest,9,1,1
98.5.9,98.5,I think I just come back there again when there are only 3 restaurants on our planet,17,1,1
